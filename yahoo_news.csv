Pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts Alternatives to high-yield savings accounts Overview of today's high-yield savings account rates Tips for finding the best high-yield savings account How to open a high-yield savings account HYSA frequently asked questions (FAQs) Why should I open a savings account? Opening a savings account is a smart financial move. For one, these accounts provide a safe place to store your money while earning interest, helping your savings grow over time. Plus, unlike keeping cash on hand or in a checking account, a savings account encourages financial discipline by separating money meant for future goals from everyday spending. And as long as you open an account with a reputable, federally insured bank or credit union, your deposits are protected in case the financial institution fails — up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, per ownership category. Learn more: 6 benefits of opening a savings account you shouldn't overlook What is a high-yield savings account? A high-yield savings account functions similarly to a traditional savings account. The main difference is that HYSAs offer much higher interest rates. In fact, some of the best HYSAs offer annual percentage yields (APYs) 10 times higher than the national average savings account rate . Keep in mind that some banks may require you to maintain a minimum balance to earn interest or avoid a monthly service charge. However, there are plenty of accounts that offer the same rate regardless of your balance and do not charge monthly fees. When shopping around for an HYSA, it's important to compare multiple offers and select an account that fits your needs. Learn more: High-yield savings account vs. traditional savings account: Which one is better? What is APY? A high-yield savings account’s interest rate represents how much you’ll earn in simple interest. On the other hand, the annual percentage yield (APY) is the rate of return including compound interest, which is the interest you earn on both the principal balance and interest you've accrued previously. Most savings accounts compound interest daily or monthly. The more often interest compounds, the faster your money will grow. HYSAs come with variable interest rates. That means your bank or credit union can change your APY at any time. Generally, APYs increase when the economy is doing well, and the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark rate. Conversely, rates can drop when the economy weakens, and the Fed lowers rates. Learn more: What is compound interest, and how is it calculated? What is a good savings account rate? Because savings account rates fluctuate, what is considered a ""good"" rate can change over time. Generally, a savings account that earns more than the national average is considered good. Today, the national average rate is just 0.39%, while the top high-yield savings accounts offer around 3% to 4% APY. Learn more: What is a good savings account interest rate? Do you pay taxes on high-yield savings accounts? Yes, the interest earned in an HYSA is taxable income . You should receive a Form 1099-INT from your bank if you earn more than $10 in interest during the year, which you need to report on your tax return. However, even if you don't receive this form, you are responsible for reporting all interest income to the IRS. Learn more: How to avoid taxes on savings account interest Pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts There are many benefits of opening a high-yield savings account, particularly the opportunity to earn a competitive rate on your balance. However, there are some drawbacks to consider as well. Let’s take a closer look at the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts : Pros: Higher interest rates: You’ll generally earn more interest than you would with a traditional savings account. Compound interest: Compounding interest helps your balance grow more quickly. Interest in an HYSA may compound daily or monthly. Accessibility: These accounts are a great place to stash money you may need to access quickly, such as your emergency fund. Other types of accounts, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), offer high rates but impose penalties if you withdraw money prior to the maturity date. Minimal or no fees: Fees with high-yield savings accounts are rare, so you won’t need to worry about these costs eating into your balance. Low-risk: High-yield savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Plus, unlike investments, account performance isn’t tied to the stock market and you can’t lose money, making HYSAs a low-risk option for your money. Cons: Variable rates: Your savings account’s APY can increase or decrease over time. While individual banks set rates at their discretion, these rates are loosely tied to the federal funds rate. Banks may choose to increase or decrease savings rates when the Fed adjusts its target rate. Minimum balance requirement: Some accounts may have a high minimum opening deposit. Tiered APYs: Some banks may have tiered APYs depending on the deposit amount. For instance, you may earn a higher rate if you deposit $5,000 vs. $100. So, while a $5,000 deposit isn’t necessarily required, it could result in a better APY. Better for short-term savings: High-yield savings accounts aren’t the best choice for long-term savings goals, like retirement. Investment accounts tend to offer higher long-term returns. Withdrawal limits may apply: Depending on your bank, you may have a limit on monthly withdrawals. Read more: Understanding the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts Alternatives to high-yield savings accounts An HYSA can be a smart place to store your savings, but it's not your only option. Here's a look at some of the alternatives you may want to consider. Money market accounts Money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts both offer higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts. However, these accounts come with different features. For instance, MMAs typically offer check-writing abilities and debit cards, though they might require higher minimum balances to earn the top interest rates. High-yield savings accounts, on the other hand, are designed to store your savings longer-term with fewer withdrawal options. Learn more about money market accounts vs. high-yield savings accounts . CDs Like high-yield savings accounts, CDs can provide a safe place to store your savings while earning a competitive return. The big difference is that CDs require you to lock in your money for a set period, known as the term, which can range from a few months to several years. For this reason, CDs are a better option for people who don't need immediate access to their funds. Learn more about high-yield savings accounts vs. CDs . Investing High-yield savings accounts and investing serve vastly different financial goals and risk profiles. HYSAs provide stable, low-risk returns with interest rates higher than traditional savings accounts. They're best for short-term financial goals or emergency funds due to their liquidity and FDIC insurance. Investing in bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and other securities typically involves higher risk — but also the potential for higher returns over the long run. Investing your money makes more sense for long-term financial goals like retirement since the returns generally outpace inflation and help grow wealth over time. Learn more about high-yield savings accounts vs. investing . Overview of today's high-yield savings account rates Today, savings accounts offer competitive rates by historical standards. Even though the national average rate for traditional savings accounts is just 0.39%, the best high-yield savings accounts still pay upwards of 4% APY. Over the past decade, savings account interest rates have experienced significant fluctuations. In the mid-2010s, rates were considerably low — below 1% — thanks to the Federal Reserve's efforts to stimulate economic growth following the 2008 financial crisis. As the economy recovered, the Fed incrementally increased the federal funds rate between 2015 and 2018, leading to a gradual rise in savings account rates. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 prompted a return to near-zero interest rates to support economic activity, resulting in a decline in savings yields. However, this led to a period of rising inflation, so the Fed implemented several rate hikes, contributing to the current higher yields on savings accounts. Even so, rates are now back on a downward trend as the Fed began cutting its target rate again in late 2024. Tips for finding the best high-yield savings account Competitive rates are great, but considering other factors besides APY can help you find an account that best meets your needs. New account offers: Look at high-yield savings account offers for new depositors with high APYs, low to no account fees, and are free to open. High savings account rates will earn you more interest, but the financial institution offering those rates might not necessarily be the best option for your finances, so do your research before opening an account. Required deposits: Research applicable deposit requirements. Is there a minimum initial deposit requirement? Do any other deposit requirements apply? Are there tiered APYs depending on your deposit amount? Fees: Some accounts may have monthly maintenance fees or other fees. Look into which fees may apply before opening a new account. Accessibility: Understand how you can access your money before opening a new account. For example, can you log into an online dashboard? Does your bank have a mobile app? Is it connected to an ATM network? Deposit options: Review available deposit options. Are mobile check deposits via a mobile banking app an option? Can you make direct deposits via an ATM? Account linking: Look into whether you can link your new account to an existing checking account at another bank. Make sure there are no restrictions or waiting periods when it comes to accessing your money. Learn more: How to choose the right high-yield savings account for you . How to open a high-yield savings account Once you’ve determined the best high-yield savings account for you, opening one is simple and can be done in person or online. You’ll generally need to provide your personal information, proof of identity, and address to open a new account. Make sure you have your driver’s license, Social Security number, and copies of a recent mortgage statement or utility bill. Depending on the account, a minimum deposit amount could apply when you open your HYSA account. If that’s the case, you’ll also need to be ready to transfer money from an existing account to meet the deposit requirement. Learn more: How to open a high-yield savings account Frequently asked questions about high-yield savings accounts Is your money safe in a HYSA?

There’s been no single cause, like there was last April when President Donald Trump’s trade war sent markets into a fearful tailspin. Instead, it’s been a slow drumbeat of news that is sowing anxiety about valuations that many suspected had already run up too far — and causing investors to pull back all at once.

He speaks on “Bloomberg The Close.”Source: Bloomberg That was clear again on Thursday, when the S&P 500 slid 1.2%, its third straight daily decline, and the Nasdaq 100 extended its deepest slide since April. Software stocks extended their tumble after artificial-intelligence startup Anthropic rolled out a new model that’s designed to carry out financial research, the second time this week the company has jolted markets, underscoring the competitive threat from the new technology. Silver — which had tracked gold to record highs — cratered 20%. Bitcoin dropped more than 13%, erasing all of the gains seen since Trump’s election 15 months ago, as investors unwound money-losing trades financed with borrowed money. US Treasuries rallied, resuming their usual role as a haven of last resort. And after the closing bell, Amazon.com Inc. plunged more than 11% when it said it plans to invest $200 billion this year, far more than the amount forecast by analysts who’ve grown increasingly concerned that tech companies are overspending on AI. Those jitters spilled into Asian markets on Friday, with South Korean stocks sinking over 5% at one point and chipmakers Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. among the biggest drags. European stocks slid and Nasdaq 100 Index futures fell 0.4%. “People are definitely going more defensive,” said Brian Frank, president and portfolio manager at Frank Funds. “It’s more of like a shoot first and ask questions later type environment. The recent activity marks a strong shift from the mood on Wall Street heading into the year, when strategists were predicting that stocks were poised for the longest winning streak in nearly two decades. The forecasts rested on expectations that the AI boom would continue, the surprisingly resilient economy would keep bolstering corporate profits and that the Federal Reserve would dial down interest rates. Story Continues That outlook remains largely in place, as evidenced by the solid earnings reports that have been rolling out in recent weeks. But there’s also been a renewed focus on some of the mounting risks: The companies that will be displaced by the AI boom; questions about the direction of the Fed if Trump’s pick, Kevin Warsh, is confirmed as Jerome Powell’s replacement as chair; and stretched valuations — on assets like gold, Bitcoin, or even tech giants like Alphabet Inc. — that may not be sustainable in the long run. Fresh labor-market data also added to the pressure on markets Thursday. New figures from Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. showed companies announced the largest number of job cuts for any January since the depths of the Great Recession in 2009, adding to concerns that economic momentum may be starting to crack. The reversal was most dramatic for Bitcoin. After a meteoric rise for much of last year as Trump’s victory set off a speculative rush into cryptocurrencies, the market for such tokens has tumbled sharply this month as investors yanked out cash. On Thursday, the selloff in Bitcoin deepened as the trading day wore on, dragging down other tokens, exchange-traded funds and the treasury companies like Strategy Inc. that hold vast sums of coins. By late afternoon in New York, it had slumped 13% to just over $63,000, wiping out roughly half its value since it hit a record high four months ago. “The fear and uncertainty across the market is evident,” said Chris Newhouse, head of business development at Ergonia. In the stock market, the drop was more subdued. Yet the pressure was broad based, with nine of 11 major industry groups in the S&P 500 retreating. In addition to the worries about which companies will wind up on the losing end of AI technology, investors have been worried about whether the massive investments in the technology will wind up paying off. That was evident in the drop by Google’s parent, Alphabet, which slipped after outlining an ambitious spending plan even as revenue beat estimates. Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, said the recent retreat is a reflection of the worries that the hottest stocks and the other assets, like gold, had simply run-up too far and were due for a little reckoning. “It’s a reset,” she said. “Momentum may have just strung itself out.” --With assistance from Matt Turner, Boris Korby and Michael Msika.

Parliamentarian Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu, whose party is aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s, plans to introduce a private member’s bill in the coming months barring children under 16 from maintaining social media accounts. The aim is to ensure data privacy and protect children and adolescents from exploitation, Devarayalu said in an interview.

State level officials and India’s finance ministry have also raised the issue of potential harms from social media. Any move to limit access to platforms in the world’s most populous nation would be a blow to the likes of Meta Platforms Inc.’s Instagram and Facebook, Snap Inc.’s Snapchat, Elon Musk’s X and more. Australia blocking under-16s from social media has prompted governments around the world to propose following suit, and a similar move by India would be the most significant yet by the number of users affected. Instagram and Facebook each have over 400 million users in India, more than any other country, according to DataReportal, a library of reports on global digital behavior. Snapchat has more than 200 million on its platform there, making India its largest market by users, while X has more than 20 million users, the data shows. While the companies typically earn less revenue per user in India than in more economically developed countries such as the US, India represents unrivaled potential for growth. It is home to the world’s largest remaining pool of untapped digital consumers, with legions of people yet to get online. Devarayalu said responsibility for ensuring compliance would rest with the tech firms. Penalties according to his planned Social Media Age Restrictions and Online Safety Bill could be as much as 2.5 billion rupees ($28 million) or 5% of a company’s global revenue, whichever is lower. “If we can ban apps like TikTok, or the ones for gambling, this can be done easily as well because the resources are there for it,” he said. Story Continues India in 2020 blocked TikTok and other Chinese apps on national security grounds and last year put in place a law banning online gambling. A Meta spokesperson said that the company wants young people to have safe experiences, that it thinks parents should decide which apps teens use, and that bans could push young people toward more dangerous parts of the internet. “We’ll comply with social media bans where they are enforced,” the spokesperson said. Snap and X, along with India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Devarayalu, 42, entered parliament in 2019 and is the vice chairman of a group of educational institutions in Andhra Pradesh. The southern state is studying Australia’s ban on children using social media, its minister in charge of technology and human resources said last month. Meanwhile, the IT minister for populous Maharashtra state, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, has ordered a task force be assembled to recommend methods for addressing the harms of social media to children. In a Monday post on X, he cited the “alarming rise in digital addiction among children and its adverse impact on their mental and physical well-being.” The minister, Ashish Shelar, said in an interview on Wednesday that a minimum age hadn’t been specified. Last week, India’s Economic Survey raised age-based restrictions on social media use as an issue for discussion. The annual survey is released by India’s Ministry of Finance and represents an annual report card on the economy and lays out the outlook for the country. Australia in December became the world’s first democracy to initiate such a social media crackdown with its under-16 ban. Several countries have since made similar moves or signaled they’re considering action. Spain’s prime minister on Tuesday said the country would limit social media use for those under 16, and at least six other countries, including France, the UK, and the Netherlands, are weighing similar restrictions.

2026-02-06 18:41:42,"1 Dividend Stock to Buy Now as Trump Tackles Housing Affordability Trump’s push to lower mortgage rates, cap card interest, and curb institutional home buying puts dividend‑payer Lennar at the center of the housing‑affordability trade, with the stock still trading at a modest discount.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-dividend-stock-buy-now-003002470.html,"In this article: LEN President Donald Trump is now openly pushing to make homeownership more attainable by calling for lower mortgage rates and directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a step he argues will help pull borrowing costs down from current levels near 6% on a 30‑year loan. He is also urging Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for a year, down from an average near 21%, to help households save faster for down payments. At the same time, he is seeking to ban large institutional investors from buying single‑family homes so ordinary buyers are not competing with deep‑pocketed landlords.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else. Amid this news, one established homebuilder has been thrust into the spotlight — Lennar Corporation (LEN). Lennar shares jumped roughly 8% in the past month, following many of these headlines. Still, the bigger question is whether this income‑paying name now offers a compelling way to gain exposure. Let’s dive in. LEN’s Income Backed by Real Numbers Lennar Corporation is a Miami‑based homebuilder designing and constructing affordable, move‑up, and active‑adult homes across the United States. Its equity base stands near $27.9 billion, and it returns cash through a forward annual dividend of $2 per share, which currently implies a yield of about 1.8%. At a share price of $115 as of this writing on Feb. 5, LEN is up about 11% year‑to‑date but down 10% over the last 52 weeks. www.barchart.com The forward price‑to‑earnings (P/E) multiple of 17.39x versus a sector median of 18.20x, alongside a price‑to‑book (P/B) ratio of 1.28x versus 2.67x, points to a modest discount. Lennar's latest financial results, released on Dec.16, 2025, showed total sales of roughly $9.4 billion, up 6.33% year-over-year, while net income fell to about $490.2 million, down 17.04%. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter of $2.03 versus a consensus estimate of $2.23, an 8.97% shortfall, which reflects tighter margins and incentives needed to keep homes moving. The report indicated operating cash flow of roughly $216.8 million for November 2025, more than doubling with 114.05% growth. While overall net cash flow was negative at about $1.16 billion, it still represented a 64.14% improvement from the prior year as LEN invested heavily in land, communities, and its pipeline. Story Continues Lennar Expands Affordable Housing Footprint Lennar is leaning directly into the affordability theme. The company recently began selling homes at River Bridge Ranch, a single‑family community in San Marcos, Texas, aimed at cost‑conscious buyers. Homes there range from 1,200 to 2,780 square feet, with three to five bedrooms and two to three bathrooms. Pricing starts in the mid‑$200,000 range. Each home comes with a standard features package included in the base price, which lines up with the kind of attainable product likely to benefit. Lennar has also been active on the capital‑allocation side. On Nov. 26, 2025, it reported final results of an exchange offer covering up to 33,298,764 shares of Millrose Properties Class A stock, about 20% of Millrose’s outstanding shares, in exchange for Lennar Class A common stock. The offer, which expired on Nov. 21, 2025, was oversubscribed, with 85,296,924 Lennar shares validly tendered and not withdrawn; 84,518,299 were subject to proration, and 778,625 were “odd‑lot” shares accepted in full. Lennar’s Outlook Through Wall Street’s Lens Lennar’s next big check‑in with the market lands on March 19, when it will report results for the quarter ending February 2026. Expectations here are deliberately conservative. The current quarter EPS estimate sits at $0.96 versus $2.14 earned in the same period a year earlier, pointing to an estimated year‑over‑year decline of about 55.14%. Looking a step ahead, for the quarter ending May 2026, the average EPS estimate is $1.41, down from $1.90 last year and implying a year‑over‑year drop of roughly 25.79%. On the rating side, the consensus stance from 19 analysts is a “Hold” — not an outright bullish call but far from a bearish one. The average price target stands at $107.15, compared with the current share price, which implies downside from here. www.barchart.com Conclusion Trump’s renewed focus on housing affordability makes Lennar look like a reasonable dividend name to own rather than avoid. The business is still growing, cash flow is improving, and the balance sheet moves plus affordable communities point in the right direction. Near term, the stock may cool or drift sideways after the recent jump on Trump home headlines. Over the next year or two, the risk-reward still appears tilted slightly higher as policy support and fundamentals gradually converge.

Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $751.2 million vs analyst estimates of $742.4 million (20.8% year-on-year growth, 1.2% beat) Adjusted EPS: $4.79 vs analyst estimates of $4.74 (1.1% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $269 million vs analyst estimates of $263.7 million (35.8% margin, 2% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $780 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $738 million Operating Margin: 26.6%, in line with the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 152, up from 139 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $54.46 billion “Our results demonstrate our continued success in transforming from a chip-only, semiconductor supplier to a full service, silicon-based solutions provider,” said Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS. Company Overview Founded in 1997 by its longtime CEO Michael Hsing, Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) is an analog and mixed signal chipmaker that specializes in power management chips meant to minimize total energy consumption. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Thankfully, Monolithic Power Systems’s 27% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth surpassed the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy). Monolithic Power Systems Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but short-term results matter for semiconductors because the rapid pace of technological innovation (Moore's Law) could make yesterday's hit product obsolete today. Monolithic Power Systems’s annualized revenue growth of 23.8% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Monolithic Power Systems Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Monolithic Power Systems reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 20.8%, and its $751.2 million of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 1.2%. Beyond the beat, this marks 8 straight quarters of growth, showing that the current upcycle has had a good run - a typical upcycle usually lasts 8-10 quarters. Company management is currently guiding for a 22.3% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Story continues Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 16.6% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Still, this projection is above average for the sector and implies the market is baking in some success for its newer products and services. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Monolithic Power Systems’s DIO came in at 152, which is 11 days below its five-year average. These numbers show that despite the recent increase, there’s no indication of an excessive inventory buildup. Monolithic Power Systems Inventory Days Outstanding Key Takeaways from Monolithic Power Systems’s Q4 Results It was great to see Monolithic Power Systems’s revenue guidance for next quarter top analysts’ expectations. We were also happy its adjusted operating income outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its inventory levels materially increased. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock traded up 1.5% to $1,175 immediately following the results. So do we think Monolithic Power Systems is an attractive buy at the current price? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

2026-02-06 18:41:50,Amazon Plans Its Own Big Boost In AI Spending. The Stock Is Tumbling. Amazon shares took a hit in extended trading Thursday after the cloud giant missed quarterly earnings estimates and followed peers with a big AI spending forecast.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-plans-own-big-boost-223816356.html,"In this article: AMZN Key Takeaways Amazon shares took a hit in extended trading Thursday after the cloud giant missed quarterly earnings estimates and followed peers with a big AI spending forecast. CEO Andy Jassy said that the company expects a ""strong long-term return"" on its investments. Amazon has big AI spending plans. That isn't helping its stock. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud giant tumbled over 7% in extended trading Thursday after the company missed quarterly earnings estimates and took Wall Street by surprise with a massive spending forecast that landed as investors are increasingly looking for evidence that big AI spending is paying off—and some of its big tech counterparts say they plan to keep shelling out. Amazon ( AMZN ) said its capital expenditures could reach $200 billion this year as it invests heavily in AI and robotics. That was well above the roughly $160 billion analysts expected. Why This Is Significant Several of Amazon's Big Tech peers, including cloud leaders Microsoft and Google , also saw shares take a hit recently after announcing larger-than-expected spending forecasts. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that the company expects a ""strong long-term return"" on its investments. He pointed to signals of strong demand at Amazon's cloud segment, which recorded its fastest growth in 13 quarters and which Jassy said on Thursdays' conference call would be the main recipient of the company's spending. Amazon Web Services revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $35.6 billion in the fourth quarter, above analysts' estimates. That helped propel Amazon's total revenue for the quarter to a record $213.4 billion. Earnings per share, however, came in just short of the analyst consensus at $1.95. Amazon said it expects first-quarter revenue of $173.5 billion and $178.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were expecting $175.38 billion. The company's report followed another from Google parent Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), which yesterday said it too planned to continue plowing money into AI technology . Amazon's stock, the weakest-performing Magnificent Seven member in 2025, was down about 4% for the year so far through Thursday's close. It finished today around $223, well off Wall Street's consensus price target near $300. Read the original article on Investopedia"

Company Overview With a network of 161 specialized facilities across 37 states and Puerto Rico, Encompass Health (NYSE:EHC) operates inpatient rehabilitation hospitals that help patients recover from strokes, hip fractures, and other debilitating conditions. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Over the last five years, Encompass Health grew its sales at a mediocre 5% compounded annual growth rate. This was below our standard for the healthcare sector and is a poor baseline for our analysis. Encompass Health Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Encompass Health’s annualized revenue growth of 11.2% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting some bright spots. Encompass Health Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can better understand the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its same-store sales, which show how much revenue its established locations generate. Over the last two years, Encompass Health’s same-store sales averaged 4.9% year-on-year growth. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth, we can see the opening of new locations is boosting the company’s top-line performance. Story Continues Encompass Health Same-Store Sales Growth This quarter, Encompass Health grew its revenue by 9.9% year on year, and its $1.54 billion of revenue was in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 8.6% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is commendable and suggests the market sees success for its products and services. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming. Click here to access a free report on our 3 favorite stocks to play this generational megatrend . Adjusted Operating Margin Encompass Health’s adjusted operating margin has risen over the last 12 months and averaged 17.2% over the last five years. Its solid profitability for a healthcare business shows it’s an efficient company that manages its expenses effectively. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Encompass Health’s adjusted operating margin of 17.2% for the trailing 12 months may be around the same as five years ago, but it has increased by 1.8 percentage points over the last two years. Encompass Health Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (Non-GAAP) This quarter, Encompass Health generated an adjusted operating margin profit margin of 16.1%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Encompass Health’s EPS grew at a spectacular 13.6% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 5% annualized revenue growth. However, we take this with a grain of salt because its adjusted operating margin didn’t improve and it didn’t repurchase its shares, meaning the delta came from reduced interest expenses or taxes. Encompass Health Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) In Q4, Encompass Health reported adjusted EPS of $1.46, up from $1.17 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Encompass Health’s full-year EPS of $5.46 to grow 6.1%. Key Takeaways from Encompass Health’s Q4 Results It was good to see Encompass Health beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter despite in line revenue. We were also happy its full-year EPS guidance outperformed Wall Street’s estimates, and this outlook is driving the stock up. Overall, this print had some key positives.

Revenue Growth Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. With $6.28 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, SS&C is one of the larger companies in the business services industry and benefits from a well-known brand that influences purchasing decisions. As you can see below, SS&C’s 6% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was decent. This shows its offerings generated slightly more demand than the average business services company, a useful starting point for our analysis. SS&C Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. SS&C’s annualized revenue growth of 6.8% over the last two years aligns with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was stable. Story continues SS&C Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, SS&C reported year-on-year revenue growth of 8%, and its $1.65 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 1.8%. Company management is currently guiding for a 7.5% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 5.4% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. Despite the slowdown, this projection is above the sector average and indicates the market sees some success for its newer products and services. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

Operating Margin Operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D. SS&C has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a business services business, boasting an average operating margin of 22.8%. Looking at the trend in its profitability, SS&C’s operating margin decreased by 1.7 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. SS&C Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, SS&C generated an operating margin profit margin of 22.3%, down 1.1 percentage points year on year. This reduction is quite minuscule and indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. SS&C’s unimpressive 7.4% annual EPS growth over the last five years aligns with its revenue performance. This tells us it maintained its per-share profitability as it expanded. SS&C Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For SS&C, its two-year annual EPS growth of 15.4% was higher than its five-year trend. This acceleration made it one of the faster-growing business services companies in recent history. In Q4, SS&C reported adjusted EPS of $1.69, up from $1.58 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 5%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects SS&C’s full-year EPS of $6.15 to grow 8%. Key Takeaways from SS&C’s Q4 Results Revenue and EPS both beat, which is a good start. We enjoyed seeing SS&C beat analysts’ full-year EPS guidance expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year revenue guidance exceeded Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The stock remained flat at $74.89 immediately after reporting. Should you buy the stock or not? We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

Viasat (VSAT) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $1.16 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.17 billion (3% year-on-year growth, 1% miss) Adjusted EPS: $0.79 vs analyst estimates of $0.24 (significant beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $387 million vs analyst estimates of $387.2 million (33.5% margin, in line) Operating Margin: 2.3%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was $444.2 million, up from -$33.17 million in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $5.37 billion Company Overview Operating a fleet of 23 satellites that orbit the Earth and beam connectivity from space, Viasat (NASDAQ:VSAT) provides satellite-based communications networks and services for airlines, maritime vessels, governments, businesses, and residential customers worldwide. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. With $4.62 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Viasat is one of the larger companies in the business services industry and benefits from a well-known brand that influences purchasing decisions. As you can see below, Viasat’s 15.4% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. This is an encouraging starting point for our analysis because it shows Viasat’s demand was higher than many business services companies. Viasat Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Viasat’s annualized revenue growth of 10.2% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Viasat Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Viasat’s revenue grew by 3% year on year to $1.16 billion, falling short of Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4.2% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health. The 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Story continues Operating Margin Operating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses – everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes. Although Viasat was profitable this quarter from an operational perspective, it’s generally struggled over a longer time period. Its expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 5.9% over the last five years. Unprofitable business services companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Viasat’s operating margin decreased by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Viasat’s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn’t pass them onto its customers. Viasat Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, Viasat generated an operating margin profit margin of 2.3%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Sadly for Viasat, its EPS declined by 2.6% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 15.4%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. Viasat Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) We can take a deeper look into Viasat’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Viasat’s operating margin was flat this quarter but declined by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 105%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders. Viasat Diluted Shares Outstanding Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business. For Viasat, its two-year annual EPS declines of 26.7% show it’s continued to underperform. These results were bad no matter how you slice the data. In Q4, Viasat reported adjusted EPS of $0.79, up from $0.11 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Viasat’s full-year EPS of $1.03 to shrink by 27.5%. Key Takeaways from Viasat’s Q4 Results It was good to see Viasat beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its revenue slightly missed. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The market seemed to be hoping for more, and the stock traded down 1.5% to $36.91 immediately after reporting. So should you invest in Viasat right now? The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy.

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.12 per share was 19% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Udemy? Find out in our full research report . Udemy (UDMY) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: On December 17, 2025, Udemy and Coursera entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Coursera will combine with Udemy in an all-stock transaction. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Udemy stockholders will receive 0.800 shares of Coursera common stock for each share of Udemy common stock. Upon the closing of the transaction, existing Coursera stockholders are expected to own approximately 59% and existing Udemy stockholders are expected to own approximately 41% of the combined company, on a fully diluted basis. Revenue: $194 million vs analyst estimates of $193.2 million (3% year-on-year decline, in line) Adjusted EPS: $0.12 vs analyst estimates of $0.10 (19% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $21.45 million vs analyst estimates of $19.67 million (11.1% margin, 9% beat) Free Cash Flow Margin: 6.1%, similar to the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $696.2 million “Udemy demonstrated strong execution in Q4 and throughout 2025, creating tangible momentum toward becoming the system of record for helping companies upskill their workforce in an increasingly AI-driven world,” said Udemy President & CEO Hugo Sarrazin. Company Overview With courses ranging from investing to cooking to computer programming, Udemy (NASDAQ:UDMY) is an online learning platform that connects learners with expert instructors who specialize in a wide range of topics. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Unfortunately, Udemy’s 7.9% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was tepid. This fell short of our benchmark for the consumer internet sector and is a poor baseline for our analysis. Udemy Quarterly Revenue This quarter, Udemy reported a rather uninspiring 3% year-on-year revenue decline to $194 million of revenue, in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years.

Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Story Continues Cash Is King Although EBITDA is undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can’t use accounting profits to pay the bills. Udemy has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company’s free cash flow margin averaged 6.9% over the last two years, slightly better than the broader consumer internet sector. Taking a step back, we can see that Udemy’s margin expanded by 21 percentage points over the last few years. This is encouraging, and we can see it became a less capital-intensive business because its free cash flow profitability rose more than its operating profitability. Udemy Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin Udemy’s free cash flow clocked in at $11.79 million in Q4, equivalent to a 6.1% margin. This result was good as its margin was 3 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, building on its favorable historical trend. Key Takeaways from Udemy’s Q4 Results We were impressed by how significantly Udemy blew past analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 2.5% to $4.83 immediately following the results.

2026-02-06 18:59:14,"The job market is off to a rocky start this year, new data shows",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/job-market-off-rocky-start-215946107.html,"A New York Department of Labor job fair at the Downtown Central Library in Buffalo, N.Y., in 2025. (Lauren Petracca / Bloomberg via Getty Images file) · Lauren Petracca New data on jobs and layoffs this week points to more job cuts and lackluster hiring plans, indicating 2026 might not be the fresh start many job seekers are looking for. A monthly survey of layoff announcements from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday found that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January, the highest cuts for the first month of the year since 2009. Last January, employers announced cuts just shy of 50,000 jobs, according to Challenger. In January 2009, more than 240,000 job cuts were announced. The firm also reported that employers announced the lowest total for hiring plans for the month of January since 2009, the year the firm started tracking the metric. Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for the firm, wrote that the high cut count signals “employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026.” However, JPMorgan noted that comparing the cuts to 2009 could be misleading. “While the report noted that 108k job cuts were the highest for January since 2009, this could be misleading on the severity,” JPMorgan said in a Thursday note. “This January was much more similar to recent January values than it was to 2009.” The bulk of announced cuts came from the transportation and technology sectors, followed by the health care sector, the firm reported, citing job cut announcements from UPS and Amazon. Last week, Amazon announced it would be cutting 16,000 jobs and UPS said it planned to slash up to 30,000 roles. The primary reasons for the January cuts reported by Challenger were cited as lost contracts, market and economic conditions, and restructuring. Only 7% of total January cuts were attributed to AI replacing workers, the firm said. Economist Mohamed A. El-Erian called the data “sobering” in a post on X . “Most notably, these layoffs are occurring while GDP continues to grow at approximately 4%, accelerating the decoupling of employment from economic growth — a phenomenon that, if it persists, has profound economic, political, and social implications,” he added. The release of the most closely watched jobs report for January, by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, was postponed due to the brief government shutdown. The January jobs report will now be released on Feb. 11. Another jobs report from ADP Research released Wednesday estimated that the private sector added just 22,000 jobs in January, driven primarily by an additional 74,000 roles in education and health services. ADP said the slowdown came from cuts in manufacturing, professional and business services and among large employers. Story Continues The Department of Labor on Thursday reported an increase of 22,000 initial claims for unemployment insurance for the week ending Jan. 31, over the previous week. Evercore ISI said in a Thursday note that the unemployment claims should “put some downside pressure on Treasury yields and the dollar.” It estimated that payroll employment increased by around 75,000 jobs last month. However, BLS did release data on job openings and labor turnover for December on Thursday. The bureau reported that nonfarm job openings “continued to trend down” for the month, with a decrease of 386,000 openings. The largest dips came from professional and business services, followed by retail trade and finance and insurance. BLS said openings were down by nearly a million roles over the year. “The job market has continued to reflect a low-hire, low-fire dynamic,” Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said in an emailed statement. “The key question now is whether we’re slipping into a weaker environment.” As BLS prepares to release its official employment report for last month, more layoffs have already begun. On Wednesday, The Washington Post cut a third of its staff. This article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

Additionally, we materially improved the risk profile of the Closed Block, and returned significant capital to our shareholders,” said Richard P. McKenney, president and chief executive officer. Company Overview Tracing its roots back to 1848 when financial security for workers was virtually non-existent, Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) provides workplace financial protection benefits including disability, life, accident, critical illness, dental and vision insurance primarily through employers. Revenue Growth Insurance companies earn revenue from three primary sources: 1) The core insurance business itself, often called underwriting and represented in the income statement as premiums 2) Income from investing the “float” (premiums collected upfront not yet paid out as claims) in assets such as fixed-income assets and equities 3) Fees from various sources such as policy administration, annuities, or other value-added services. Regrettably, Unum Group’s revenue grew at a sluggish 1.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmarks and is a poor baseline for our analysis. Unum Group Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within financials, a half-decade historical view may miss recent interest rate changes and market returns. Unum Group’s annualized revenue growth of 3% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, but we were still disappointed by the results. Unum Group Year-On-Year Revenue Growth Note: Quarters not shown were determined to be outliers, impacted by outsized investment gains/losses that are not indicative of the recurring fundamentals of the business. This quarter, Unum Group missed Wall Street’s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 0.1% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $3.24 billion of revenue. Story Continues Net premiums earned made up 80.8% of the company’s total revenue during the last five years, meaning Unum Group barely relies on non-insurance activities to drive its overall growth. Unum Group Quarterly Net Premiums Earned as % of Revenue While insurers generate revenue from multiple sources, investors view net premiums earned as the cornerstone - its direct link to core operations stands in sharp contrast to the unpredictability of investment returns and fees. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming. Click here to access a free report on our 3 favorite stocks to play this generational megatrend . Book Value Per Share (BVPS) Insurers are balance sheet businesses, collecting premiums upfront and paying out claims over time. Premiums collected but not yet paid out, often referred to as the float, are invested and create an asset base supported by a liability structure. Book value per share (BVPS) captures this dynamic by measuring these assets (investment portfolio, cash, reinsurance recoverables) less liabilities (claim reserves, debt, future policy benefits). BVPS is essentially the residual value for shareholders. We therefore consider BVPS very important to track for insurers and a metric that sheds light on business quality because it reflects long-term capital growth and is harder to manipulate than more commonly-used metrics like EPS. Unum Group’s BVPS grew at a tepid 4.7% annual clip over the last five years. However, BVPS growth has accelerated recently, growing by 16% annually over the last two years from $49.91 to $67.11 per share. Unum Group Quarterly Book Value per Share Over the next 12 months, Consensus estimates call for Unum Group’s BVPS to grow by 24.4% to $78.65, elite growth rate. Key Takeaways from Unum Group’s Q4 Results We struggled to find many positives in these results. Its EPS missed and its book value per share fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 7.5% to $70.04 immediately after reporting. Unum Group underperformed this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now?

Additionally, as highlighted last quarter, we continue to invest in AI and broader automation efforts internally to drive greater efficiency and productivity across our business, as evidenced by our increasing free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margins. I would also like to thank all of our Paylocity teams as they support our clients through our busiest time of year,” said Toby Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paylocity. Company Overview Operating in a field where companies traditionally juggled multiple disconnected systems, Paylocity (NASDAQ:PCTY) provides cloud-based human capital management and payroll software solutions that help businesses manage their workforce and HR processes. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Paylocity grew its sales at a solid 23.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Story Continues Paylocity Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within software, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Paylocity’s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 14% over the last two years was below its five-year trend. Paylocity Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Paylocity reported year-on-year revenue growth of 10.4%, and its $416.1 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 1.9%. Company management is currently guiding for a 7.7% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 6.4% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. The 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Annual Recurring Revenue While reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable. Paylocity’s ARR came in at $387 million in Q4, and over the last four quarters, its growth was underwhelming as it averaged 13% year-on-year increases. This performance mirrored its total sales and suggests that increasing competition is causing challenges in securing longer-term commitments. Paylocity Annual Recurring Revenue Customer Acquisition Efficiency The customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it’s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability. Paylocity is very efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 27.6 months this quarter. The company’s rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs means it can attempt to spur growth by increasing its sales and marketing investments. Paylocity CAC Payback Period Key Takeaways from Paylocity’s Q4 Results We enjoyed seeing Paylocity beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year EBITDA guidance slightly exceeded Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this print had some key positives. The market seemed to be hoping for more, and the stock traded down 1.4% to $125.51 immediately after reporting. So do we think Paylocity is an attractive buy at the current price? The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy.

Coty (COTY) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $1.68 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.66 billion (flat year on year, 1.1% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.14 vs analyst expectations of $0.18 (24.2% miss) Adjusted EBITDA: $330.2 million vs analyst estimates of $338.1 million (19.7% margin, 2.3% miss) Operating Margin: 8.8%, down from 16.1% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 30.6%, up from 25.1% in the same quarter last year Organic Revenue fell 3% year on year (beat) Market Capitalization: $3 billion Company Overview With a portfolio boasting many household brands, Coty (NYSE:COTY) is a beauty products powerhouse spanning cosmetics, fragrances, and skincare. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. With $5.81 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Coty carries some recognizable products but is a mid-sized consumer staples company. Its size could bring disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from better brand awareness and economies of scale. As you can see below, Coty’s sales grew at a sluggish 3.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years. This shows it failed to generate demand in any major way and is a rough starting point for our analysis. Coty Quarterly Revenue This quarter, Coty’s $1.68 billion of revenue was flat year on year but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 1.1%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection doesn't excite us and implies its newer products will not accelerate its top-line performance yet.

This metric captures a business’s performance excluding one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures as well as foreign currency fluctuations.

Story Continues Coty Year-On-Year Organic Revenue Growth In the latest quarter, Coty’s organic sales fell by 3% year on year. This decrease represents a further deceleration from its historical levels. We hope the business can get back on track. Key Takeaways from Coty’s Q4 Results It was good to see Coty narrowly top analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also happy its organic revenue was in line with Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its EPS missed and its EBITDA fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 14% to $2.71 immediately after reporting. Coty’s earnings report left more to be desired. Let’s look forward to see if this quarter has created an opportunity to buy the stock. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

2026-02-06 18:59:25,Amazon stock falls after earnings on $200 billion capex plan,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-stock-falls-earnings-200-214541347.html,"In this article: AMZN Amazon’s fourth-quarter earnings had two distinct personalities. The first was the one investors have been paying for lately : a cleaner, sharper Amazon that’s figured out how to make its scale throw off real profit. The second was the one Amazon can’t stop becoming when the next platform shift shows up on the horizon: a company willing to pour concrete, string fiber, and buy chips like it’s trying to build the future faster than anyone can invoice it. Both versions showed up in the same document. The quarter itself was strong. And then CEO Andy Jassy volunteered the sentence that made everything else feel like preamble: “With such strong demand for our existing offerings and seminal opportunities like AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites, we expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026, and anticipate strong long-term return on invested capital.” The market’s response wasn’t “Nice quarter.” It was “Excuse me, you’re spending HOW much?” In a week when investors have started treating AI spending plans the way Americans treat rising restaurant menu prices — with widening eyes and a sudden interest in doing the math — Amazon effectively walked up to order the tasting menu for the whole table. Shares fell as much as 10% in after-hours trading. Big Tech’s capex plans have become the market’s favorite form of indigestion, and a bad tape doesn’t exactly make investors more patient about long-dated payoffs. AWS does the heavy lifting The underlying print was, by most conventional measures, strong. Amazon beat the revenue number analysts were carrying into the report (about $211.4 billion), and AWS came in above expectations. Earnings per share landed at $1.95, a hair below the $1.97 many previews were modeling — the kind of miss that normally gets filed under “within the noise.” Amazon’s framing leaned on momentum: AWS delivered “our fastest growth in 13 quarters,” advertising grew 23%, and custom chips were up triple digits, the company said. But this earnings season has been running on a different fuel. The market is no longer grading these companies on whether they can post big numbers. The market is grading these companies on whether they can explain why the big numbers are worth the even bigger checks. The largest Big Tech players are expected to spend more than $500 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, and investors have started picking favorites based on who pairs spending with clean growth and who pairs it with softer near-term outlooks . Amazon put itself squarely in the second bucket, not because the quarter was weak, but because its guidance invited a heavy dose of skepticism. Story continues The company’s first-quarter operating income forecast — $16.5 billion to $21.5 billion — came in below the $22.04 billion analysts were expecting; operating income is the bridge between “trust us, we’re investing” and “here’s the profit you can actually underwrite.” The same release that celebrated acceleration also warned that Q1 would absorb higher costs, including about $1 billion of incremental “Amazon Leo” expenses year over year, plus investment in faster commerce and sharper pricing in international stores. The capex number, though, is what turned a fairly straightforward earnings story into a referendum. Amazon’s $200 billion figure forces investors to rewrite their free-cash-flow assumptions in real time. The bill comes due The company already told everyone this movie’s first act: trailing-12-month operating cash flow rose 20% to $139.5 billion, but trailing-12-month free cash flow fell to $11.2 billion, driven “primarily” by a $50.7 billion year-over-year increase in property-and-equipment purchases tied to AI investment. Capex isn’t a theoretical risk here . It’s already compressing the numbers investors underwrite. Amazon’s capex has already been running at an eye-watering pace: close to $38 billion in the fourth quarter alone, which makes the 2026 figure feel like quite an acceleration. Heading into the print, capex expectations were clustered well below $200 billion — sometimes closer to $150 billion. A $200 billion plan doesn’t just imply more data centers and more chips. It implies more depreciation, more execution risk, and a longer runway before the cash returns feel obvious. It also raises the question that now hangs over every hyperscaler call: Is this spending being pulled by customer demand or being pushed by competitive fear? The near-term outlook didn’t help. Amazon guided first-quarter operating income to $16.5 billion to $21.5 billion, tied to roughly $1 billion of higher year-over-year costs tied to scaling its low-Earth-orbit satellite effort, plus more investment in quick commerce and sharper pricing internationally. Sales outside North America jumped 17% in the quarter, but operating income slipped to $1 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier. Amazon is still buying growth abroad, even as it asks investors to fun a historic infrastructure build. Amazon made the demand case as hard as it could in its press release. It highlighted an expanding stable of AI offerings and customer wins; it pointed to momentum in its custom silicon, saying Trainium and Graviton have a combined annual revenue run rate above $10 billion; and it described large-scale infrastructure projects meant to ease capacity constraints. That’s all well and great. But investors aren’t disputing that Amazon can spend. They’re disputing the timeline for when spending turns into a cleaner profit and cash narrative — and, for now, some investors aren't willing to take that on faith. There’s a reason AWS remains the emotional center of this story: It generates about 60% of Amazon’s operating profit. When AWS is accelerating, the market is inclined to believe the capex will be absorbed and monetized. When the forward profit guide looks light, the market starts wondering whether the bill is arriving faster than the payoff. Meanwhile, Amazon’s rivals are posting faster percentages — so Amazon can be telling a demand story and still have to act like its playing defense. Amazon wants to be the company that invests like a national utility and earns like a software platform, all while trimming and reorganizing elsewhere to prove it’s still serious about efficiency and margins. In late January, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts as part of a broader restructuring push . So: cut costs in the org chart, spend aggressively in the data center, and ask investors to focus on long-term returns. Amazon is telling investors that it’s choosing to spend — on infrastructure, on speed, on pricing, on a satellite business it’s explicitly flagging as a scaling cost — at the exact moment investors are re-litigating what “responsible” looks like in the AI era. The quarter gave Amazon plenty of ammunition — better-than-expected revenue, stronger AWS growth, solid operating income, and a set of businesses that still know how to scale. The guidance and capex number demand a second, more difficult thing: a credible explanation of pacing and payoff. Now, Amazon has one job: to make the $200 billion feel like an answer to demand instead of a reflex to competition. Investors can tolerate a build year. They just want to know whether they’re funding a backlog or funding an AI arms race."

On the other hand, next quarter’s revenue guidance of $72.5 million was less impressive, coming in 19.9% below analysts’ estimates. Its GAAP loss of $0.04 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Impinj? Find out in our full research report . Impinj (PI) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $92.85 million vs analyst estimates of $92.44 million (1.4% year-on-year growth, in line) EPS (GAAP): -$0.04 vs analyst estimates of -$0.04 (in line) Adjusted EBITDA: $16.43 million vs analyst estimates of $18.14 million (17.7% margin, 9.4% miss) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $72.5 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $90.56 million EBITDA guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $1.95 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $12.78 million Operating Margin: -2.9%, up from -3.9% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 14.7%, up from 9.3% in the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 173, down from 177 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $4.58 billion Company Overview Founded by Caltech professor Carver Mead and one of his students Chris Diorio, Impinj (NASDAQ:PI) is a maker of radio-frequency identification (RFID) hardware and software. Revenue Growth Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, Impinj’s 21% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was exceptional. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions. Impinj Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but short-term results matter for semiconductors because the rapid pace of technological innovation (Moore's Law) could make yesterday's hit product obsolete today. Impinj’s annualized revenue growth of 8.4% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Impinj Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Impinj grew its revenue by 1.4% year on year, and its $92.85 million of revenue was in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Company management is currently guiding for a 2.4% year-on-year decline in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 22.5% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is healthy and suggests its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance.

We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Impinj’s DIO came in at 173, which is 8 days above its five-year average. These numbers suggest that despite the recent decrease, the company’s inventory levels are higher than what we’ve seen in the past. Impinj Inventory Days Outstanding Key Takeaways from Impinj’s Q4 Results It was good to see Impinj improve its inventory levels, even if just slightly. On the other hand, its EBITDA missed and revenue guidance for next quarter missed. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 18.4% to $126.09 immediately following the results.

Revenue Growth Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last five years, Molina Healthcare grew its sales at an impressive 18.7% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. Molina Healthcare Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Molina Healthcare’s annualized revenue growth of 15.5% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Molina Healthcare Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can dig further into the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of customers, which reached 5.49 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Molina Healthcare’s customer base averaged 50,884,975% year-on-year growth. Because this number is better than its revenue growth, we can see the average customer spent less money each year on the company’s products and services. Story Continues Molina Healthcare Customers This quarter, Molina Healthcare reported year-on-year revenue growth of 8.3%, and its $11.38 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 3.7%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 2.7% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.

Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Operating Margin Operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D. Molina Healthcare was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 3.5% was weak for a healthcare business. Looking at the trend in its profitability, Molina Healthcare’s operating margin decreased by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. This performance was caused by more recent speed bumps as the company’s margin fell by 2.9 percentage points on a two-year basis. We still like Molina Healthcare but would like to see it make some adjustments. Molina Healthcare Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, Molina Healthcare generated an operating margin profit margin of negative 1.4%, down 5 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Sadly for Molina Healthcare, its EPS declined by 5.9% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 18.7%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded due to non-fundamental factors such as interest expenses and taxes. Molina Healthcare Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) We can take a deeper look into Molina Healthcare’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Molina Healthcare’s operating margin declined by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals. In Q4, Molina Healthcare reported adjusted EPS of negative $2.75, down from $5.05 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts’ estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Molina Healthcare’s full-year EPS of $10.65 to grow 26.5%. Key Takeaways from Molina Healthcare’s Q4 Results We enjoyed seeing Molina Healthcare beat analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its full-year revenue guidance missed and its full-year EPS guidance fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 33.4% to $117.85 immediately after reporting. Molina Healthcare underperformed this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now?

Bloom Energy (BE) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $777.7 million vs analyst estimates of $655.1 million (35.9% year-on-year growth, 18.7% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.45 vs analyst estimates of $0.30 (50.4% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $146.1 million vs analyst estimates of $107 million (18.8% margin, 36.6% beat) Operating Margin: 17.1%, down from 18.3% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 50.8%, down from 82.7% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $34.85 billion KR Sridhar, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Bloom Energy said, “Bring-your-own-power has shifted from a slogan to a business necessity for AI hyperscalers and manufacturing facilities. This shift is secular and growing. We have built a solid state digital power platform for the digital age that is superior to any legacy solution.” Company Overview Working in stealth mode for eight years, Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) designs, manufactures, and markets solid oxide fuel cell systems for on-site power generation. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Thankfully, Bloom Energy’s 20.6% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth surpassed the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. Bloom Energy Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. Bloom Energy’s annualized revenue growth of 23.2% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated. Bloom Energy Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can better understand the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its most important segments, Product and Service, which are 82.1% and 7.9% of revenue. Over the last two years, Bloom Energy’s Product revenue (energy servers and electrolyzers) averaged 26.3% year-on-year growth while its Service revenue (operations and maintenance agreements) averaged 12.6% growth. Story Continues Bloom Energy Quarterly Revenue by Segment This quarter, Bloom Energy reported wonderful year-on-year revenue growth of 35.9%, and its $777.7 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 18.7%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 23.7% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection is eye-popping and indicates the market is baking in success for its products and services. The 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Operating Margin Although Bloom Energy was profitable this quarter from an operational perspective, it’s generally struggled over a longer time period. Its expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 6.3% over the last five years. Unprofitable industrials companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. On the plus side, Bloom Energy’s operating margin rose by 17.6 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. Still, it will take much more for the company to show consistent profitability. Bloom Energy Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, Bloom Energy generated an operating margin profit margin of 17.1%, down 1.2 percentage points year on year. Since Bloom Energy’s gross margin decreased more than its operating margin, we can assume its recent inefficiencies were driven more by weaker leverage on its cost of sales rather than increased marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead expenses. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Bloom Energy’s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last five years. This is a good sign and shows it’s at an inflection point. Bloom Energy Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For Bloom Energy, its two-year annual EPS growth of 151% was higher than its five-year trend. We love it when earnings growth accelerates, especially when it accelerates off an already high base. In Q4, Bloom Energy reported adjusted EPS of $0.45, up from $0.43 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Bloom Energy’s full-year EPS of $0.73 to grow 47.1%. Key Takeaways from Bloom Energy’s Q4 Results It was good to see Bloom Energy beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its EBITDA outperformed Wall Street’s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its Service revenue missed. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 9.1% to $151 immediately following the results. Bloom Energy had an encouraging quarter, but one earnings result doesn’t necessarily make the stock a buy. Let’s see if this is a good investment. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

2026-02-06 10:01:01,Estée Lauder Stock Tumbled 20% Today. Here's What Dragged the Shares Lower,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-stock-tumbled-214113017.html,"In this article: EL Key Takeaways Estée Lauder's latest results beat expectations, and the company raised its outlook. Investors, however, didn't like what they saw. After rising more than 45% in the past year, the shares dropped today, finishing 19% lower. Estée Lauder's latest forecast wasn't a winning look. The cosmetics company reported second-quarter results Thursday that sent investors running—and the stock to its lowest close since December—despite results that beat expectations and an improved outlook for the year. The company's reiteration of a $100 million expected second-half tariff hit to profits, along with the stock's steady climb off April lows that may have led to high expectations, likely weighed on the shares. Why This News Matters to Consumers Economists have long said consumers will shoulder most of the cost of tariffs. There has been debate about how long this process may take, as some companies, such as Estée Lauder, acknowledge they have not yet offset the expense. Estée Lauder Cos. ( EL ), parent company of Bobbi Brown and Clinique, hoped to cast its results as long-awaited progress. Sales picked up in Europe, China and other Asian markets. And after 10 years of losing market share, Estée Lauder is gaining ground in the Americas by expanding beyond department stores and selling via Amazon ( AMZN ), Tik Tok and Sephora, CEO Stéphane de la Faverie said on a conference call Thursday. ""One of the main challenges that we see is: the enacted tariffs are starting to hurt consumer confidence in Latin America,"" de la Faverie said, according to a transcript provided by Alpha Sense. ""But overall, I want to say, I feel very strong."" The company reported $4.2 trillion in sales for the quarter ended Dec. 31—a 6% increase from last year, and slightly above the consensus analyst estimate from Visible Alpha. That translated to about $0.89 in adjusted earnings per share, compared to the $0.82 analysts anticipated, per Visible Alpha. Estée Lauder also raised its earnings outlook for the full fiscal year. The company expects to end 2026 with an adjusted operating profit margin of 9.8% to 10.2%, despite a dip in the third quarter due to tariffs and other headwinds. That's up from the 9.4% to 9.9% margin given in prior guidance. Today's investor reaction, however, was deeply negative, with the shares finishing 19% lower even after a bounce from intraday lows. The stock finished Wednesday's session above Wall Street's consensus price target, per Visible Alpha Data; it's now some 15% below it. Read the original article on Investopedia 查看留言"

Guidance for next quarter’s revenue was optimistic at $1.26 billion at the midpoint, 2.4% above analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.44 per share was 2.7% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Microchip Technology? Find out in our full research report . Microchip Technology (MCHP) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $1.19 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.18 billion (15.6% year-on-year growth, 0.6% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.44 vs analyst estimates of $0.43 (2.7% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $337.8 million vs analyst estimates of $324.7 million (28.5% margin, 4% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $1.26 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $1.23 billion Adjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $0.50 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $0.49 Operating Margin: 12.8%, up from 3% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 26.9%, up from 24.7% in the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 201, up from 198 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $42.28 billion Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s CEO and President commented that, “Our fiscal third quarter results exceeded our expectations, with net sales of $1.186 billion growing 4% sequentially, and 15.6% year-over-year, well above our original guidance. We believe the broad-based recovery across our end markets, combined with significant margin expansion, demonstrates the tangible impact of our nine-point recovery plan execution. Our non-GAAP operating profit grew sequentially more than our net sales did in the December quarter, highlighting the operational momentum we have in our business.” Company Overview Spun out from General Instrument in 1987, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: MCHP) is a leading provider of microcontrollers and integrated circuits used mainly in the automotive world, especially in electric vehicles and their charging devices. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Microchip Technology’s demand was weak and its revenue declined by 3.8% per year. This wasn’t a great result and suggests it’s a low quality business. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions. Story continues Microchip Technology Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Microchip Technology’s recent performance shows its demand remained suppressed as its revenue has declined by 28.5% annually over the last two years. Microchip Technology Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Microchip Technology reported year-on-year revenue growth of 15.6%, and its $1.19 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 0.6%. Adding to the positive news, Microchip Technology’s growth inflected positively this quarter, news that will likely give some shareholders hope. Company management is currently guiding for a 29.8% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 21.9% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is noteworthy and indicates its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Microchip Technology’s DIO came in at 201, which is 25 days above its five-year average, suggesting that the company’s inventory has grown to higher levels than we’ve seen in the past. Microchip Technology Inventory Days Outstanding Key Takeaways from Microchip Technology’s Q4 Results We enjoyed seeing Microchip Technology beat analysts’ adjusted operating income expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this print had some key positives. Investors were likely hoping for more, and shares traded down 4% to $75.03 immediately after reporting. Should you buy the stock or not?

StepStone Group (STEP) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Assets Under Management: $220 billion vs analyst estimates of $840.5 billion (22.9% year-on-year growth, 73.8% miss) Revenue: $586.5 million vs analyst estimates of $418.3 million (140% year-on-year growth, 40.2% beat) Pre-tax Profit: -$194.6 million (-33.2% margin) Adjusted EPS: $0.65 vs analyst estimates of $0.62 (4.7% beat) Market Capitalization: $5.06 billion Company Overview Operating as both an advisor and asset manager with over $100 billion in assets under management, StepStone Group (NASDAQ:STEP) is an investment firm that provides clients with access to private market investments across private equity, real estate, private debt, and infrastructure. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Thankfully, StepStone Group’s 34% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth surpassed the average financials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. StepStone Group Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within financials, a half-decade historical view may miss recent interest rate changes, market returns, and industry trends. StepStone Group’s annualized revenue growth of 47.9% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated. StepStone Group Year-On-Year Revenue Growth Note: Quarters not shown were determined to be outliers, impacted by outsized investment gains/losses that are not indicative of the recurring fundamentals of the business. This quarter, StepStone Group reported magnificent year-on-year revenue growth of 140%, and its $586.5 million of revenue beat Wall Street’s estimates by 40.2%. Microsoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend. We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Assets Under Management (AUM) Assets Under Management (AUM) represents the total value of investments that a financial institution manages for its clients. These assets generate steady income through management fees, creating predictable revenue streams that remain stable so long as clients remain invested with the firm. Story Continues StepStone Group’s AUM has grown at an annual rate of 23.4% over the last five years, much better than the broader financials industry but slower than its total revenue. When analyzing StepStone Group’s AUM over the last two years, we can see that growth decelerated to 21.3% annually. Fundraising or short-term investment performance were net detractors to the company over this shorter period since assets grew slower than total revenue. That said, assets aren't the be-all and end-all due to their unpredictable and cyclical nature. StepStone Group Assets Under Management StepStone Group’s AUM punched in at $220 billion this quarter, falling 73.8% short of analysts’ expectations. This print was 22.9% higher than the same quarter last year. Key Takeaways from StepStone Group’s Q4 Results We were impressed by how significantly StepStone Group blew past analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its AUM missed. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock remained flat at $59.04 immediately after reporting. Big picture, is StepStone Group a buy here and now? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

Its GAAP profit of $0.49 per share was 3.7% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Exponent? Find out in our full research report . Exponent (EXPO) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $147.4 million vs analyst estimates of $128.1 million (19.1% year-on-year growth, 15.1% beat) EPS (GAAP): $0.49 vs analyst estimates of $0.47 (3.7% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $34.71 million vs analyst estimates of $36.08 million (23.5% margin, 3.8% miss) Operating Margin: 19.8%, down from 22% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $3.50 billion “We delivered a strong finish to 2025 reflecting the strength, diversification, and resilience of our portfolio,” stated Dr. Catherine Corrigan, President and Chief Executive Officer. Company Overview With a team of over 800 consultants holding advanced degrees in 90+ technical disciplines, Exponent (NASDAQ:EXPO) is a science and engineering consulting firm that investigates complex problems and provides expert analysis for clients across various industries. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. With $554.8 million in revenue over the past 12 months, Exponent is a small player in the business services space, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and numerous distribution channels. On the bright side, it can grow faster because it has more room to expand. As you can see below, Exponent grew its sales at a solid 8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This shows it had high demand, a useful starting point for our analysis. Exponent Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Exponent’s annualized revenue growth of 5.6% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were respectable. Exponent Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Exponent reported year-on-year revenue growth of 19.1%, and its $147.4 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 15.1%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4.1% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and suggests its products and services will see some demand headwinds. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Story Continues Operating Margin Exponent has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a business services business, boasting an average operating margin of 24.3%. Looking at the trend in its profitability, Exponent’s operating margin decreased by 3.5 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Exponent Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, Exponent generated an operating margin profit margin of 19.8%, down 2.3 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Exponent’s unimpressive 6% annual EPS growth over the last five years aligns with its revenue performance. On the bright side, this tells us its incremental sales were profitable. Exponent Trailing 12-Month EPS (GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business. For Exponent, its two-year annual EPS growth of 3.2% was lower than its five-year trend. We hope its growth can accelerate in the future. In Q4, Exponent reported EPS of $0.49, up from $0.46 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 3.7%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Exponent’s full-year EPS of $2.07 to grow 7.8%. Key Takeaways from Exponent’s Q4 Results We were impressed by how significantly Exponent blew past analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock remained flat at $70.83 immediately after reporting. So should you invest in Exponent right now? What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.

Revenue Growth A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Luckily, Doximity’s sales grew at an impressive 29.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth surpassed the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. Doximity Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within software, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Doximity’s annualized revenue growth of 16.7% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were respectable.

Company management is currently guiding for a 3.8% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years.

We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Customer Acquisition Efficiency The customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period measures the months a company needs to recoup the money spent on acquiring a new customer. This metric helps assess how quickly a business can break even on its sales and marketing investments. Doximity is extremely efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 6.4 months this quarter. The company’s rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs indicates it has a highly differentiated product offering and a strong brand reputation. These dynamics give Doximity more resources to pursue new product initiatives while maintaining the flexibility to increase its sales and marketing investments. Key Takeaways from Doximity’s Q4 Results We enjoyed seeing Doximity beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed and its EBITDA guidance for next quarter fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 32.5% to $22.50 immediately after reporting. The latest quarter from Doximity’s wasn’t that good. One earnings report doesn’t define a company’s quality, though, so let’s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price.

The company expects next quarter’s revenue to be around $106.5 million, close to analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.23 per share was 19.5% above analysts’ consensus estimates.

Power Integrations (POWI) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $103.2 million vs analyst estimates of $103 million (1.9% year-on-year decline, in line) Adjusted EPS: $0.23 vs analyst estimates of $0.19 (19.5% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $10.02 million vs analyst estimates of $8.13 million (9.7% margin, 23.2% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $106.5 million at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting Operating Margin: 8.5%, up from 3.7% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 18.6%, up from 11.1% in the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 313, up from 277 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $2.61 billion Power Integrations CEO Jen Lloyd commented: “I am pleased that we returned to growth in 2025 with a six-percent increase in total revenue, led by our industrial category which grew 15 percent. The growth in industrial was driven by record sales in our high-power gate-driver business, plus strength in metering, power tools, automotive and broad-based industrial applications. Additionally, total revenue from PowiGaN™ products grew more than 40 percent for the year.” Company Overview A leading supplier of parts for electronics such as home appliances, Power Integrations (NASDAQ:POWI) is a semiconductor designer and developer specializing in products used for high-voltage power conversion. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Power Integrations’s demand was weak over the last five years as its sales fell at a 1.9% annual rate. This wasn’t a great result and suggests it’s a low quality business. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions. Power Integrations Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Power Integrations’s revenue over the last two years was flat, sugggesting its demand was weak but stabilized after its initial drop. Story Continues Power Integrations Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Power Integrations reported a rather uninspiring 1.9% year-on-year revenue decline to $103.2 million of revenue, in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Company management is currently guiding for flat sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 7.6% over the next 12 months. Although this projection indicates its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.

Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Power Integrations’s DIO came in at 313, which is 86 days above its five-year average, suggesting that the company’s inventory has grown to higher levels than we’ve seen in the past. Power Integrations Inventory Days Outstanding Key Takeaways from Power Integrations’s Q4 Results It was good to see Power Integrations beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its adjusted operating income outperformed Wall Street’s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its inventory levels materially increased. Overall, we think this was still a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. Investors were likely hoping for more, and shares traded down 3.3% to $45.84 immediately after reporting.

Its GAAP profit of $0.34 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy News Corp? Find out in our full research report . News Corp (NWSA) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $2.36 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.29 billion (5.5% year-on-year growth, 3% beat) EPS (GAAP): $0.34 vs analyst estimates of $0.34 (in line) Adjusted EBITDA: $517 million vs analyst estimates of $498.9 million (21.9% margin, 3.6% beat) Operating Margin: 10.2%, down from 16.3% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 5.6%, down from 6.8% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $14.33 billion Company Overview Established in 2013 after a restructuring, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) is a multinational conglomerate known for its news publishing, broadcasting, digital media, and book publishing. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Unfortunately, News Corp struggled to consistently increase demand as its $8.62 billion of sales for the trailing 12 months was close to its revenue five years ago. This was below our standards and is a sign of poor business quality. News Corp Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or trend. Just like its five-year trend, News Corp’s revenue over the last two years was flat, suggesting it is in a slump. News Corp Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can better understand the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its three most important segments: Dow Jones, News Media, and Book Publishing, which are 27%, 25.8%, and 23.6% of revenue. Over the last two years, News Corp’s Dow Jones (media subsidiary) and News Media (general media) revenues averaged year-on-year growth of 6.2% and 1.6% while its Book Publishing revenue (general publishing) averaged 2.1% declines. News Corp Quarterly Revenue by Segment This quarter, News Corp reported year-on-year revenue growth of 5.5%, and its $2.36 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 3%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3% over the next 12 months. Although this projection implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming.

Story Continues Operating Margin Operating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses – everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes. News Corp’s operating margin has been trending down over the last 12 months and averaged 10.3% over the last two years. The company’s profitability was mediocre for a consumer discretionary business and shows it couldn’t pass its higher operating expenses onto its customers. News Corp Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, News Corp generated an operating margin profit margin of 10.2%, down 6.1 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. News Corp’s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last five years. This is encouraging and shows it’s at a critical moment in its life. News Corp Trailing 12-Month EPS (GAAP) In Q4, News Corp reported EPS of $0.34, down from $0.38 in the same quarter last year. This print slightly missed analysts’ estimates. We also like to analyze expected EPS growth based on Wall Street analysts’ consensus projections, but there is insufficient data. Key Takeaways from News Corp’s Q4 Results It was encouraging to see News Corp beat analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also happy its EBITDA outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its EPS was in line. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock traded up 1.3% to $24.94 immediately following the results. Big picture, is News Corp a buy here and now? We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

2026-02-06 10:01:18,Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q4 CY2025: Beats On Revenue But Stock Drops,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-nasdaq-amzn-q4-cy2025-212600289.html,"In this article: AMZN GOOG MSFT AAPL Cloud computing and online retail behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q4 CY2025, with sales up 13.6% year on year to $213.4 billion. The company expects next quarter’s revenue to be around $176 billion, close to analysts’ estimates. Its GAAP profit of $1.95 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Amazon? Find out in our full research report . Amazon (AMZN) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $213.4 billion vs analyst estimates of $211.6 billion (0.9% beat) Operating Profit (GAAP): $24.98 billion vs analyst estimates of $25.08 billion (small miss) EPS (GAAP): $1.95 vs analyst expectations of $1.96 (in line) North America Revenue: $127.1 billion vs analyst estimates of $127 billion (small beat) AWS Revenue: $35.58 billion vs analyst estimates of $34.85 billion (2.1% beat) North America Operating Profit: $11.47 billion vs analyst estimates of $10.83 billion (6% beat) AWS Operating Profit: $12.47 billion vs analyst estimates of $12.06 billion (3.3% beat) Operating Margin: 11.7%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 7%, down from 10.4% in the same quarter last year Capex guidance: ""we expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026 "" (>50% year-on-year increase) Market Capitalization: $2.49 trillion “AWS growing 24% (our fastest growth in 13 quarters), Advertising growing 22%, Stores growing briskly across North America and International, our chips business growing triple digit percentages year-over-year—this growth is happening because we’re continuing to innovate at a rapid rate, and identify and knock down customer problems,” said Andy Jassy, President and CEO, Amazon. Revenue Growth Amazon shows that fast growth and massive scale can coexist despite conventional wisdom. The company’s revenue base of $386.1 billion five years ago has increased to $716.9 billion in the last year, translating into an excellent 13.2% annualized growth rate. Over the same period, Amazon’s big tech peers Alphabet, Microsoft, and Apple put up annualized growth rates of 17.2%, 14.8%, and 8.2%, respectively. This is an important consideration because investors often use the comparisons as a starting point for their valuations. When adjusting for these benchmarks, we think Amazon’s price is fair. Quarterly Revenue of Big Tech Companies Long-term growth reigns supreme in fundamentals, but for big tech companies, a half-decade historical view may miss emerging trends in AI. Amazon’s annualized revenue growth of 11.7% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Story Continues Amazon Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Amazon reported year-on-year revenue growth of 13.6%, and its $213.4 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 0.9%. Company management is currently guiding for a 13.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side This projection is admirable for a company of its scale and illustrates the market sees some success for its newer products. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Profitability: The Key Debate Many investors understand that Amazon’s e-commerce business caps its gross margin, which averaged 46.8% over the last five years. The company lags behind its pure-play tech peers because it sells many commoditized goods online where it must acquire and hold physical inventory. What the market debates, however, is where Amazon’s long-term operating profitability could ultimately settle. Sure, its five-year margin of 7.6% was mediocre, but it rose by 5.9 percentage points thanks to leverage on the fixed costs in its consumer-facing businesses and the highly profitable AWS segment becoming a larger portion of its revenue. Our question is if Amazon’s momentum can continue and result in a mid-to-high teen percentage margin somewhere down the line. Amazon Gross and Operating Margins (GAAP) The company’s North America segment holds the keys to this answer. Throughout the years, Amazon has made huge investments to not only attract hoards of customers into its ecosystem but also retain them. Some areas of focus in this effort included its unmatched delivery network and video streaming content. Bulls will argue that Amazon can afford to ease up and begin riding its investments of the last two-plus decades. Wall Street seems to agree somewhat and is projecting its trailing 12-month operating margin of 11.2% to reach 12.8% in the coming year. Combined with its performance over the last few years, this suggests Amazon’s long-term profitability could go much higher, potentially leading to earnings and a stock price that follows. Key Takeaways from Amazon’s Q4 Results It was encouraging to see Amazon narrowly top analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter, and the beat in Amazon Web Services was a bright spot. And while operating profit missed, all-important AWS segment operating profit beat. On the other hand, its operating income guidance for next quarter missed. Additionally, the company guided to $200 billion of capex in 2026, a more than 50% increase compared to 2025. Overall, this was a mixed quarter with the spending forecast spooking the markets. The stock traded down 5.5% to $210.70 immediately after reporting. The latest quarter from Amazon’s wasn’t that good. One earnings report doesn’t define a company’s quality, though, so let’s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

2026-02-06 10:01:20,QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) Beats Expectations in Strong Q4 CY2025,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quinstreet-nasdaq-qnst-beats-expectations-212336289.html,"In this article: QNST Performance marketing company QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) reported Q4 CY2025 results beating Wall Street’s revenue expectations , with sales up 1.9% year on year to $287.8 million. On top of that, next quarter’s revenue guidance ($335 million at the midpoint) was surprisingly good and 4.5% above what analysts were expecting. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.24 per share was 21.2% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy QuinStreet? Find out in our full research report . QuinStreet (QNST) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $287.8 million vs analyst estimates of $276.2 million (1.9% year-on-year growth, 4.2% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.24 vs analyst estimates of $0.20 (21.2% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $20.98 million vs analyst estimates of $19.43 million (7.3% margin, 8% beat) Revenue Guidance for the full year is $1.28 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $1.23 billion EBITDA guidance for the full year is $112.5 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $101.5 million Operating Margin: 0.4%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 6.3%, down from 12.7% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $654.3 million Company Overview Founded during the dot-com era in 1999 and specializing in high-intent consumer traffic, QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) operates digital performance marketplaces that connect clients in financial and home services with consumers actively searching for their products. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. With $1.11 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, QuinStreet is a small player in the business services space, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and numerous distribution channels. On the bright side, it can grow faster because it has more room to expand. As you can see below, QuinStreet’s sales grew at an incredible 16.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This is a great starting point for our analysis because it shows QuinStreet’s demand was higher than many business services companies. QuinStreet Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. QuinStreet’s annualized revenue growth of 41.8% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated. QuinStreet Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, QuinStreet reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 1.9% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 4.2%. Company management is currently guiding for a 24.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Story continues Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 14.3% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is admirable and implies the market is forecasting success for its products and services. Microsoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend. We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Operating Margin QuinStreet’s operating margin has risen over the last 12 months, leading to break even profits over the last five years. Although this result isn’t exceptional, we can see its elite revenue growth is giving it operating leverage as it scales. This gives it a shot at long-term profitability if it can keep expanding. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, QuinStreet’s operating margin might fluctuated slightly but has generally stayed the same over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. QuinStreet Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, QuinStreet’s breakeven margin was 0.4%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. QuinStreet’s EPS grew at a solid 10.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. However, this performance was lower than its 16.3% annualized revenue growth, telling us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. QuinStreet Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For QuinStreet, its two-year annual EPS growth of 454% was higher than its five-year trend. We love it when earnings growth accelerates, especially when it accelerates off an already high base. In Q4, QuinStreet reported adjusted EPS of $0.24, up from $0.20 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects QuinStreet’s full-year EPS of $0.92 to grow 43.4%. Key Takeaways from QuinStreet’s Q4 Results It was good to see QuinStreet beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. We were also glad its revenue guidance for next quarter trumped Wall Street’s estimates. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 1.6% to $11.24 immediately after reporting. Indeed, QuinStreet had a rock-solid quarterly earnings result, but is this stock a good investment here? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

In 2026, it’s been trading more like a meme stock than a safe haven.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-most-boring-investment-started-100047255.html,"In this article: GC=F Gold bars and coins at precious metal dealer Pro Aurum on February 2, 2026, in Munich, Germany. Gold prices have experienced intense volatility in recent weeks. - Sven Hoppe/dpa/picture alliance/Getty Images Gold has been considered a store of value for thousands of years. In 2026, it’s been trading more like a meme stock than a safe haven. Investors often flock to gold when crises hit, inflation spikes or stocks slump as a way to preserve their money’s worth. But gold prices have been extraordinary volatile, smashing through record highs before posting their biggest single-day drop on record last month. Gold is now up roughly 15% this year. Gold has had monster rallies before: Its best year on record was 1979, rising 144% as the US economy experienced rampant inflation and geopolitical tensions surged. And prices rallied 24% in 2020 as the pandemic upended the global economic status quo. This time, gold is benefiting from rising geopolitical tensions. And as traders bought more, the gains gathered steam, resulting in skyrocketing prices. Investing in metals is easier than ever before: Traders can buy and sell exchange-traded funds that track the price of gold and silver just like buying and selling stocks. The SPDR Gold ETF — a popular fund that tracks the performance of physical gold — in August saw its biggest monthly inflows on record, according to FactSet data. US markets in recent years have experienced bouts of so-called meme stock mania , where traders pile into a hype-fueled rally to try and ride a surge in a stock’s share price. Analysts say a similar theme is playing out in the metals market: Gold and silver have been trading like meme stocks. A golden opportunity Gold rose 27% in 2024 and 67% in 2025. The yellow metal hit $4,000 a troy ounce for the first time in October before eclipsing $5,000 in January. “I think there was a wide range of different hedgers, speculators, hedge funds, retail traders, they were all kind of moving aggressively in and actually driving the prices higher than we would have expected and beyond the point where it was sustainable to hold,” said Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist and head of US public policy at the World Gold Council. Despite posting its biggest single-day drop on record on January 30, gold is still up this year. But the recent volatility has made some analysts wonder if gold still has the same luster as an investment. Meanwhile, bitcoin has dropped 50% since hitting a record high above $126,000 in October. Traders who had chased bitcoin’s rally could have shifted focus to metals, analysts say, helping fuel the volatility. “It is distorting gold’s historic role as a haven. It’s now trading like a momentum-driven market at the extremities of the risk asset spectrum,” David Scutt, market analyst at Forex.com, said in an email. Story Continues The fundamental outlook remains positive for gold, economists say. JPMorgan Chase expects gold prices to hit $6,300 a troy ounce by the end of 2026. While traders are trying to cash in on the rally, geopolitical uncertainty persists, boding well for gold prices. Historic volatility Silver has also experienced extraordinary volatility. Silver prices more than tripled across the past year before plunging 31% on January 30 and posting their worst day since 1980 . Silver is still up roughly 138% across the past year. Gold on Tuesday jumped 6.07% and had its best day since 2009 just two days after having its worst day on record. The Cboe Gold Volatility Index surged this year to its highest level since the Covid pandemic in 2020, reflecting the intensity of the metal’s recent volatility. “It’s hard to justify calling something a hedge when it has double-digit swings,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told CNN. “Your hedges are not supposed to be the most volatile portion of your portfolio.” “When you see these kind of declines, they’re spectacular, they’re painful,” he added, “but they’re in some ways the natural outcome of hyper-aggressive speculation.” For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com View Comments"

The premium kids' food company is known for its products, ranging from refrigerated pouches and oat bars to protein bars, puffs, and melts. Its core consumer is kids between the ages of two and five. In the first half of 2025, the company's sales hit $201.6 million, up 64.6% from 2018, as it expanded its offerings and footprint. In 2017, Garner and industry veteran John Foraker joined the company as co-founders alongside Cassandra Curtis, who founded the company in 2015. Garner said at the time that she saw a ""tiny little company"" that offered organic, fresh, refrigerated food that she struggled to find as a mom. Upon meeting Foraker, she said the two shook hands, and the rest is history. The company continues to evolve its product lineup, with a particular focus on protein as Americans dramatically increase their consumption of the macronutrient. ""We're raising our kids alongside our consumers, so we know that protein is ... at the forefront of their minds,"" Garner said.

The company sources about 40% of its ingredients from foreign suppliers, but about 98% of packaging is sourced domestically.

2026-02-06 23:24:17,"Hiltzik: The Dow just broke 50,000. Here's what that means The Dow Jones Industrial Average just crossed 50,000 points for the first time, but that doesn't mean the economy is healthy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hiltzik-dow-just-broke-50-213948067.html,"In this article: ^DJI Trader Chris Lagana works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 50,000 for the first time. (Richard Drew / Associated Press) Round numbers always enchant humans, especially when they're big round numbers. So you'll probably be reading and hearing a lot about how the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 50,000-point threshold Friday for the first time. Actually, ""threshold"" isn't the right word. The mark's significance is psychological, if that. In real terms, nothing got triggered at that moment, which happened at about 2:27 p.m. Eastern time. No rules or regulations changed. In and of itself, it won't create a jump-up in anyone's personal net worth. It's doubtful that any trading algorithms kicked in, except those that might have been keyed to a sharp reversal of trading sentiment from earlier in the week, when it was pretty sour . Still, the chances are that attention will be paid. The Dow gained 1,206.95 points or 2.47% Friday, closing at 50,115.67. If you're inclined to make a bet, you might put your money on the likelihood that President Trump or his minions will take this to mean the overall economy is firing on all cylinders, thanks to his policies. It doesn't mean that. So let's dig a little deeper into the meaning of this particular round number. We can start by noting that the Dow not only doesn't rank as a reliable picture of the U.S. economy, it doesn't rank as a picture of the stock market as a whole. It's a price-weighted average of only 30 stocks, with higher priced stocks having a bigger influence on the average, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index tracks, well, 500, and the Nasdaq Composite more than 3,000. (Both those indices moved sharply higher Friday, too.) Read more: Hiltzik: Yes, California should tax billionaires' wealth. Here's why Yet I confess I have a soft spot for the Dow. That dates from the 1980s, when it was treated as more of an economic bellwether than now, and I was the New York financial correspondent for The Times. The Dow had been running up fairly smartly, and I pleaded with the business editor, the revered Paul Steiger, to rescind the rule mandating that I write a story on any day when the average moved 20 points or more. However, I got his agreement that the day it broke 2,000 points for the first time, I would write that story. And I did! That day was Jan. 8, 1987. “It’s a milestone because round numbers intrigue everyone,” Newton Zinder, chief market analyst for E.F. Hutton & Co., told me at the time. William LeFevre, market strategist for the Hartford-based investment firm of Advest, added: “This will bring a lot of little investors into the market, because the publicity associated with it focuses a lot of attention on the Dow.” Story Continues But as I observed then, hullabaloo over ""milestone"" numbers is typically misplaced. The Dow’s first close over 1,000 was greeted with great fanfare on Nov. 14, 1972, when investors and Wall Street professionals read it as a sign that explosive economic growth lay in store for 1973. Market analysts were nearly unanimous in forecasting that the Dow could rise an additional 150 to 300 points within two years. Sadly, no. It took nearly 10 years, or until October, 1982, for the Dow to reach even 1,100. Any optimism the 2,000-point mark inspired also proved to be misplaced. The Dow suffered a major crash of 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987, only nine months later. Comparing the trajectories of the U.S. economy and the stock market over the four decades since Dow 2,000 is an interesting exercise. In the first quarter of 1987, U.S. gross domestic product was $4.72 trillion, or $13.77 trillion in today's dollars. Today it's $31.1 trillion. So the U.S. economy has grown by 558% in nominal terms, or 125% adjusted for inflation. In that same period, the Dow Industrial average has grown by 2,400% in real terms, or an inflation-adjusted 758%. The S&P 500 has grown by 2,588% in nominal terms, or an inflation-adjusted 821%. Read more: Hiltzik: Trump's deal with Nvidia puts our national security up for sale to the highest bidder Dissertations can be written about what these comparative numbers say about, first, the long-term strength of the U.S. economy and, second, whether its majestic growth in wealth is distributed fairly. But they certainly document that corporate and capital valuations have handily outstripped economic growth generally. The bottom line is that few American households feel as if their wealth has grown by 2,400% in the last 39 years, or even 758%. As for whether it's possible to read conclusions about the economy in the Dow Industrial figures, it's hard to discern a clear pattern. For one thing, the 30 components change over time, as the average's owner, a joint venture between Standard & Poor's, and the financial services company CME Group. There's a bit of gamesmanship involved in these decisions — the most recent change, in November 2024, substituted chipmaker Nvidia for chipmaker Intel . The change kept the average consonant with the evolution of the semiconductor market; Intel shares had lost half their value in 2024, while Nvidia had more than doubled, riding the wave of its dominance over the AI chip market. Nvidia validated the average-makers' instincts: Its gain of 7.78% Friday powered much of the average's advance. Big percentage gainers included Caterpillar (up 7.06%), Goldman Sachs (4.31%), JPMorgan Chase (3.95%) and Walmart (3.34%). Somewhere in there may lie truths about the semiconductor, banking, retail and manufacturing sectors, but one day's results probably don't tell the whole story. Nvidia's gain came on the heels of a nasty week — the stock had lost 10% of its value since Jan. 29. History tells us that its unwise to take solid conclusions from short-term action in the Dow or any other index. Friday's gains could mark a lasting recovery from the market meltdown of recent weeks, or could be what market followers call a ""dead-cat bounce,"" and the cat is still dead. For the moment, still, the Dow had a very nice day. That doesn't mean the euphoria will last.

A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the broader market rebounded from a tech-driven sell-off, with investors taking the opportunity to buy stocks at lower prices. This rally was fueled by a recovery in technology stocks and a significant bounce in Bitcoin, which stabilized after losing over half its value from its October peak.

The previous big move we wrote about was 29 days ago when the stock gained 4.7% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations for both revenue and profit. Revenue increased 5.5% from the same period in the previous year to $425.7 million, while adjusted earnings came in at $1.52 per share, with both figures beating Wall Street's forecasts. In addition to the solid quarterly results, management provided full-year revenue guidance of $1.66 billion, which was above analyst estimates. The company also slightly raised its outlook for full-year adjusted earnings per share, signaling confidence in its future performance. Story Continues AZZ is up 18.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $130 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AZZ’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,568.

A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the broader market rebounded from a tech-driven sell-off, with investors taking the opportunity to buy stocks at lower prices. This rally was fueled by a recovery in technology stocks and a significant bounce in Bitcoin, which stabilized after losing over half its value from its October peak. Investor sentiment was also lifted by a surprising improvement in U.S. consumer sentiment and the realization that massive AI-related capital expenditure, such as Amazon's planned $200 billion, directly benefits chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom.

The previous big move we wrote about was 28 days ago when the stock gained 4.8% on the news that Truist Financial raised its price target on the company's shares to $8 from $6. The analyst firm's decision signaled a more positive valuation for the aerospace company, even as it maintained a ""Hold"" rating on the stock. This indicated that while the firm did not see enough reason to recommend buying the shares outright, it did believe the stock had more room to run than it previously thought. Investors reacted positively to the increased price target, which suggested improved confidence in the company's future value. Story continues AerSale is up 3% since the beginning of the year, but at $7.44 per share, it is still trading 17.3% below its 52-week high of $9 from August 2025.

Wall Street has raised its earnings expectations in recent months, especially for tech companies, which have driven earnings growth in recent quarters.

For the full year, Philip Morris expects earnings per share of $7.87 to $8.02 in 2026, a miss compared to the $8.08 midpoint the Street was looking for.

Thu, February 5, 2026 at 9:18 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Strategy reports quarterly loss as the stock gets crushed by bitcoin sell-off Strategy stock ( MSTR ) tumbled 17% on Thursday before taking another 1% hit after-hours following the release of its fourth quarter earnings. The software company led by Michael Saylor pioneered the model for companies to hoard bitcoin in corporate treasuries. These days, it’s seen as an investment proxy for bitcoin, with that side of the business becoming its organizing principle. The gambit seemed to work last year when bitcoin advanced higher and higher on hopes of easier regulation. But as the sell-off in bitcoin intensified on Thursday, it highlighted the risks in Strategy's long-term holding strategy that could make it harder for the company to raise capital. Strategy currently holds 713,502 bitcoins with an average purchase price of $76,052. On Thursday, bitcoin's spot price fell to around $63,000, bringing the company's unrealized losses to about $8.9 billion. ""HODL,"" Saylor tweeted on Thursday, referring to a tongue-in-cheek term in the crypto community that has evolved to mean ""hold on for dear life."" For the fourth quarter, Strategy reported an operating loss of $17.4 billion, compared to an operating loss of $1 billion in Q4 2024. It also reported a net loss of $12.4 billion, or $42.93 per share, well below the $5.5 billion loss to $6.3 billion profit range the company indicated in December, when it slashed its forecast from a net profit of $24 billion. The Street was expecting a loss of $20.99 per share. In the software operations, revenue increased 1.9% year over year to $123 million, driven by strong growth in product licenses and subscription services. In December, Strategy also created a US dollar reserve worth $2.25 billion, which the company said provides more than two and a half years of funds to cover its dividend. Remarking on the reserve, CFO Andrew Kang said that ""Strategy’s capital structure is stronger and more resilient today than ever before.” Listen to Strategy's earnings call live on the stock quote page. Thu, February 5, 2026 at 1:32 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Peloton posts lackluster quarter amid turnaround efforts Peloton ( PTON ) stock tumbled more than 9% in premarket trading after the connected fitness company reported a lackluster holiday quarter that failed to deliver results and shared that its CFO Liz Coddington would be departing. For the fiscal second quarter, Peloton recorded a basic loss per share of $0.09, wider than the $0.06 loss expected. Revenue was $656.5 million in the quarter, below expectations for $675.1 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Subscriptions to its connected fitness service dropped 7% year over year to 2.66 million after the company raised prices at the beginning of October. Peloton also forecast a challenging quarter ahead as the company transforms its product lineup and tries to stabilize shrinking sales. The company has added new features to its lineup, including a CrossFit training series, as it attempts to revamp offerings. In its fiscal third quarter, Peloton expects subscriptions to decrease by 8% year over year to a range of 2.65 million to 2.67 million. Revenue is expected to come in between $605 million and $625 million, a 1% decline year over year.

Wed, February 4, 2026 at 10:01 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell E.l.f. Beauty stock jumps on upbeat profit guidance E.l.f. Beauty ( ELF ) demonstrated resilience in the fourth quarter following a difficult 2025, with a strong earnings beat and guidance raise. The affordable cosmetics manufacturer lifted its full-year 2026 sales outlook to a range of $1.6 billion to $1.61 billion from its previous range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion. The company also sees greater earnings per share of $3.05-$3.10, an increase from the previous range of $2.80-$2.85. The stock soared by as much as 14% in after-hours trading as the company looks to regain its footing after higher tariffs and other challenges led the stock to lose 40% in 2025. However, the stock pared some of those gains, perhaps due to lower gross margins amid ongoing tariff costs. Last year, the company also acquired Hailey Bieber's Rhode brand. In the fourth quarter, e.l.f. reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $0.65 versus $0.55 expected by Wall Street analysts. Net sales jumped 38% to $489.5 million, topping estimates of $461 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""Our value proposition, powerhouse innovation and disruptive marketing engine continue to fuel our brands,"" CEO Tarang Amin said in a statement.

Wed, February 4, 2026 at 9:27 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Qualcomm stock dives as memory chip shortage weighs on financial outlook Qualcomm ( QCOM ) stock fell around 8% in extended trading after the chip designer's results beat on the top and bottom lines but its forecast was lighter than expected. A memory chip shortage stemming from data center developers scooping up chips and chipmakers shifting production to cater to AI demand added pressure to the company's outlook. In the fiscal first quarter, the company said revenue increased 5% year over year to $12.3 billion, while earnings per share rose to $2.78. Qualcomm beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, with consensus estimates forecasting $12.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $2.75, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, the outlook for the fiscal second quarter dimmed as a supply crunch in memory chips weighs on margins and the smartphone market. Second quarter revenue is expected in the range of $10.2 billion to $11 billion (analysts were looking for $11 billion at the midpoint). Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 (the Street was hoping for $2.87). ""While our near-term handsets outlook is impacted by industry-wide memory supply constraints, we are encouraged by end-consumer demand for premium and high tier smartphones, and remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2029 revenue goals,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in the earnings release. Wed, February 4, 2026 at 4:30 PM UTC Jake Conley The backlog just keeps growing,' Eaton CEO says as data center orders tripled During the fourth quarter earnings call for power management giant Eaton Corporation ( ETN ), CEO Paulo Ruiz Sternadt said the company's backlog of orders ""just keeps growing"" and projected a continued firehose of demand as the AI arms race powers on. Data center orders at Eaton roughly tripled in the fourth quarter over the prior year, while the backlog for its ""Electrical Americas"" division grew by 31% quarter-on-quarter to hit a new record, Sternadt said during the call on Tuesday. Eaton's stock price spiked after the report and is up by more than 6% over the past five trading sessions and by more than 16% on the year. Eaton reported fourth quarter revenue at $7.05 billion , outperforming revenue of $6.24 billion from a year ago but falling below analysts' expectations of $7.09 billion. On the bottom line, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.33 per share, outperforming estimates of $3.32 per share. Talking about Eaton's strong order backlog, Sternadt attributed much of the company's success to the demand from AI hyperscalers. ""You probably noticed on recent news from the hyperscalers that they reconfirmed their capex plans for 2026 — this is also great news that supports these projects,"" Sternadt said. ""Multi-tenant and new cloud players, they are so active, never seen them so active as they are today. If I'm to summarize the market picture here, lots of strength, and these projects will take years to complete. So that's what gives us the optimism in the future.""

The highlight of the day was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surged and crossed the historic 50,000 threshold for the first time. The shares closed the day at $14.81, up 8.1% from previous close. Is now the time to buy Rivian? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free . What Is The Market Telling Us Rivian’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 32 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 23 days ago when the stock dropped 9% on the news that UBS downgraded the electric vehicle maker's stock to 'Sell' from 'Neutral', citing a less favorable risk-to-reward outlook. The firm expressed concern that market enthusiasm for Rivian's AI and self-driving technology may have already peaked. An analyst with UBS noted that Rivian's free cash flow burn was likely to increase to $4 billion or more due to higher spending. The downgrade also reflected worries about high expectations for the company's upcoming R2 vehicle launch, with UBS forecasting sales for 2026 and 2027 to be significantly below consensus estimates. This negative sentiment was compounded by reports that the company delivered fewer vehicles in 2025 than in the prior year and came as the broader North American EV market showed signs of slowing, with sales declining 4% in 2025 after some incentives were rolled back. Rivian is down 23.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $14.78 per share, it is trading 34.2% below its 52-week high of $22.45 from December 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Rivian’s shares at the IPO in November 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $146.68. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

2026-02-07 09:28:39,"How London stock market’s big bet on data turned into a disaster Addressing London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) shareholders at the Butcher’s Hall last May, boss David Schwimmer took to the stage to herald the company’s big bet on data.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/london-stock-market-big-bet-070000090.html,"In this article: LDNXF ANTH.PVT For many, the jewel in the crown of LSEG is the London Stock Exchange, founded in 1698 - Toby Melville/Reuters Addressing London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) shareholders at the Butcher’s Hall last May, boss David Schwimmer took to the stage to herald the company’s big bet on data. “We’ve transformed LSEG from a largely European, regional exchange group to a diversified, global leader in financial markets infrastructure and data services,” he boasted. Invest in Gold American Hartford Gold: #1 Precious Metals Dealer in the Nation Learn More Priority Gold: Up to $15k in Free Silver + Zero Account Fees on Qualifying Purchase Learn More Thor Metals Group: Best Overall Gold IRA Learn More Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. Investors hailed his foresight at the time, approving a bumper £7.8m payday for Schwimmer and sending shares to a record high. But now, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have left some investors wondering whether Schwimmer’s big bet on data might be about to unravel and be forever branded as an “AI loser”. LSEG was one of several groups caught up in last week’s software bloodbath following the release of the new Claude AI automation tool from Anthropic, the Silicon Valley tech group. Shares fell to their lowest level in nearly three years, shedding more than 8pc during the week, over fears that Schwimmer had made a bad bet by putting all his eggs into one basket. In moving towards data and analytics and away from its bread and butter role running London’s stock and bond markets, there are growing fears in the market that LSEG has left itself worryingly exposed to disruption from the likes of Anthropic. “This is a week where it’s shoot first, ask questions later,” says Michael Werner, an analyst at UBS. “The challenge here is how long this AI overhang will persist. “So long as it’s there, the shares will not be driven by fundamentals – they will be driven by narratives.” For many, the jewel in the crown of LSEG is the London Stock Exchange, the historic venue founded in 1698 which helped make Britain a global financial centre. Under Schwimmer, a former Goldman Sachs banker, LSEG has been accused of relegating the British stock exchange to a mere bit part in the company’s sweeping data and analytics push. Revenue from data and analytics surpassed £4bn in 2024, accounting for nearly half of all the company’s sales. Its capital markets division, which includes the stock markets, made just £1.8bn or around a fifth of total income. LSEG began beefing up on big data in 2019 by acquiring Refinitiv, the financial information and terminal business, for $27bn (£19.8bn). Several years later, it announced a $2.8bn partnership with Microsoft to develop new data and analytic products in a bid to usurp Bloomberg and its all-encompassing terminal for financial traders. As the threat from AI has grown, LSEG has sought to push even further into data, partnering with a raft of AI companies including Anthropic and ChatGPT. Story Continues Concerns around LSEG’s business model are not new but – like elsewhere in the software and data ecosystem – they have been building in tandem with the rapid advances in AI. “We’re at the stage now with every iteration of GPT or Claude that comes out ... it’s multiples more capable than the previous generation. The market’s thinking, ‘Oh, wait, that challenges this business model’,” Kunal Kothari, a fund manager at Aviva Investors, told Reuters. Others have been cautious about LSEG’s over reliance on data before. Analysts at Barclays said investors wanted to see progress on its tie-up with Microsoft and how much money LSEG might actually make from the numerous partnerships it has recently announced. Werner, maintaining that LSEG was “guilty by association” in the recent sell-off, also said that investors “now need to see the deliverables promised by management before they give the company credit”. The jury is out on whether David Schwimmer’s pivot to data will bear any fruit - Brendan McDermid/Reuters While the sell-off has been brutal , some investors are sticking with the company – at least for now. Kothari said LSEG could succeed in an AI world and there was unlikely to be a stampede towards the latest AI tools. “We have to remember that however good the technology, it is humans that will need to decide whether to adopt it – and they need to be comfortable doing that. Typically that takes longer than you think,” he said. Niall Gallagher, a fund manager from Jupiter, added: “I’ve lived through numerous ‘hype cycles’ before – including the 1998 to 2000 TMT bubble – and whilst technology does change the world, it doesn’t happen overnight.” Gallagher said that LSEG’s core strength was the data it owned that wasn’t available elsewhere and which AI couldn’t replicate. “This does not mean that every single data set or data process inside of LSEG could not be replicated more cheaply by AI, but we do think there is a strong moat,” he said. The jury is out on whether Schwimmer’s pivot to data will bear fruit and if the company’s share price will again hit the heady heights of last year. However, there are concerns LSEG will struggle to escape the perception that it has found itself on the wrong side of the AI boom. “This situation has become slightly self-fulfilling because LSEG achieved this branding as an AI loser,” said Ben Bathurst, an analyst at RBC Capital. “What we find is that in the vast majority of our conversations with participants in the market, with investors or prospective investors in LSEG, it’s widely understood that the sell-off is overdue. “The issue is, it’s very hard to disprove some of these arguments in the short term because we’re talking about something that’s quite long-term in nature.” Try full access to The Telegraph free today.

2026-02-07 09:28:40,"These 3 Dividend Stocks Combine Income, Momentum, and Upside Three dividend stocks with strong buy ratings, solid income today, and upside potential in 2026 based on Barchart strength and analyst consensus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-dividend-stocks-combine-income-000002928.html,"In this article: ^GSPC With the S&P 500 showing signs of weakness in 2026, income investors face a familiar challenge. It’s easy to find dividend stocks. Just tick basic filters, and then you have it. More News from Barchart 1 Dividend Stock to Buy Now as Trump Tackles Housing Affordability Johnson & Johnson Is a Resilient Blue-Chip Stock and It Just Hit New All-Time Highs How Should You Play the Bloodshed in Stellantis Stock Today? Tired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now! But, it's even harder to find those that still offer upside- and without overpaying. Buying a solid business at the wrong time can cap returns, even when the yield looks attractive on the surface. Remember, yields aren't the only thing investors should be looking at. And that’s why timing and conviction matter. To find these companies, I used Barchart’s Opinion and Opinion Strength indicators, which use short-term technical signals to gauge market momentum, and paired them with strong analyst consensus. This approach helps me find dividend stocks that are paying income today while still showing signs of strength and potential. How I Came Up With The Following Dividend Stocks I used Barchart’s Stock Screener tool to get the list using the following filters. Annual Dividend Yield: Left blank so I can sort it later from highest to lowest. Overall Opinion Strength: Strong - Top 1%. A stronger signal offers a stronger opinion. Overall Opinion % : Buy. Barchart’s short-term technical indicator signals the overall opinion, indicating whether the stock is bullish or bearish. Current Analyst Rating: 4.5 - 5. Companies that are “Strong Buy” according to Wall Street. Number of Analysts: 16 or higher. The more analyst coverage, the greater the confidence rating. Dividend Investing Ideas: Dividend Stocks, Dividend Aristocrats, Dividend Kings. I hit the screen and got 5 results. I will cover three with the highest forward annual dividend yield. Let’s start with the first Dividend Stock: Permian Resources Corp (PR) Permian Resources Corp drills for oil and natural gas in the Delaware Basin, one of the most productive oil regions here in the U.S. The company operates as a pure upstream energy business focused on finding and producing oil and gas. In its most recent financials, the company reported that sales rose 9% YOY to $1.3 billion. However, its net income fell 85% to $59 million due to higher operating expenses and lower commodity prices. Still, Permian Resources has increased its dividends for two consecutive years, paying a forward annual dividend of $0.60, which translates to a yield of around 3.7%. Story continues Meanwhile, Barchart Opinion indicates a 100% overall buy average with maximum strength, suggesting bullish momentum across the short-, medium-, and long-term time frames. Plus, a consensus among 24 analysts rates the stock a “Strong Buy”, with an upside of as much as 28% should it reach the $21 high target price. Valley National Bancorp (VLY) The second Dividend Stock on my list is Valley National Bancorp . The company offers banking services, including loans, deposits, and cash management, to individuals and businesses, with a primary focus on commercial lending to small- and mid-sized companies. In its recent quarterly financial report, sales were down 4% YOY to $827 million while its net income increased 67% to $163 million. Out of that, the company pays a forward annual dividend of $0.44, translating to a yield of approximately 3.3%. Similar to Permian Resources, Barchart Opinion shows an overall 100% buy average with maximum strength, indicating favorable momentum. It also belongs to the top 1% of stocks in both strength and direction. Meanwhile, a consensus among 15 analysts rate the stock a “Strong Buy”. The high target price is $16, suggesting a potential 18% upside from current levels. Coca-Cola Company (KO) The last stock on my list is a Dividend King: Coca-Cola , a company whose products are familiar to consumers almost everywhere. It has a wide portfolio of beverages, including its namesake softdrink. In its most recent financials, the company reported that sales rose 5% YOY to $12.5 billion. Its net income also increased 30% to $3.7 billion. Coca-Cola has also increased its dividends for 63 consecutive years, making it very popular among income investors. Today, it pays a forward annual dividend of $2.04, translating to a yield of around 2.6%. It may not be the highest in this list, but it’s definitely the most stable and resilient. Meanwhile, Barchart Opinion has an overall buy average of 88%, with high strength and direction scores, indicating that there is still further to go. On the other hand, a consensus among 24 Wall Street analysts rates the stock a “Strong Buy”, suggesting there's as much as 27% potential upside should it achieve its $100 high target price. Final Thoughts These three quality dividend stocks have the analyst and Barchart Opinion scores on their side, suggesting bullish momentum across the short, medium, and long terms. That said, technical indicators and analyst ratings are only guides, not the whole story. Always do your own research and decide whether the underlying business and risks align with your investment goals.

2026-02-07 09:28:42,"Dow crosses 50K for first time as stocks enjoy best day since May 2025 Resurgent technology stocks drove the rebound after a volatile week, while bitcoin also recouped losses.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dow-crosses-50k-first-time-232329402.html,"In this article: ^GSPC ^DJI BTC-USD ^IXIC The U.S. stock market roared back on Friday, as technology stocks recovered much of their losses from earlier in the week and bitcoin halted its plunge. The S&P 500 rallied 2% for its best day since May, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 1,206 points, or 2.5%, and topped the 50,000 level for the first time. The Nasdaq composite rose 2.2%. The S&P 500 jumped 134 points to close at 6,932. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,207 to 50,115.67 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 491 points to 23,031. ""Stocks are wrapping up a volatile week of trade on a high note. The S&P 500 has once again bounced directly off support at the 100-day moving average and surpassed resistance at 6,900. Broad-based buying pressure powered today's rally as advancing shares are outpacing decliners by over 3:1,"" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, said in an email. Tech companies helped drive the widespread rally, with chipmaker Nvidia jumping 7.8% to trim its loss for the week. Semiconductor company Broadcom climbed 7.1% and erased its drop for the week. The two companies propped up the S&P 500, boosted by hopes for continued spending by customers on artificial-intelligence. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, for example, said late Thursday it expects to spend about $200 billion on investments this year to take advantage of ""seminal opportunities like AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites."" Such immense spending, similar to what Alphabet announced a day earlier, is creating concerns of its own, though. The question is whether all those dollars will generate profits to eclipse the spending. Amazon's stock dropped 5.6% amid ongoing doubt about whether investment in AI will pay off for tech giants. Even with Friday's surge, the S&P 500 still fell to its third losing week in the last four. Concerns about AI potentially taking away market share from software companies also hurt the market. Software stocks suffered after AI firm Anthropic released free tools to automate things like legal services. Bitcoin rebound Bitcoin, meanwhile, steadied following a weekslong plunge that sent it more than halfway below its record price set in October. It climbed back above $70,000 after briefly dropping close to $60,000 late Thursday. Prices in the metals market also calmed a bit following their own wild swings . Gold rose 1.8% to settle at $4,979.80 per ounce, while silver added 0.2%. Their prices suddenly ran out of momentum last week following jaw-dropping rallies, which were driven by turning to the safe-haven asset amid concerns over mounting global geopolitical uncertainty. Story Continues On Wall Street, the recovery for bitcoin helped stocks of companies enmeshed in the crypto economy. Robinhood Markets jumped 14% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500. Crypto trading platform Coinbase Global rose 13%. Strategy, the company that's made a business of buying and holding bitcoin, soared 26.1%. Improving consumer sentiment Stocks of smaller U.S. companies also helped lead the market, as well as those that depend on U.S. households spending more money, which benefited from encouraging consumer sentiment data. A preliminary report from the University of Michigan suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers is improving slightly, surprising economists. The improvement was strongest among households that own stocks, which are benefiting from the S&P 500 setting a record late last month. ""Market sentiment improved after today's positive report out of the University of Michigan. Median 1-year inflation expectations hit the lowest since January 2025, providing some comfort for investors eager to see improving inflation metrics,"" Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, said in an email. ""We think the markets may have to work through more jitters with a new Fed chair , but in the end, we think the Fed will cut rates later this year, which will grease the skids for more market appreciation."" To be sure, sentiment ""remained at dismal levels for consumers without stock holdings,"" according to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu. Airline stocks strengthened with hopes that more confidence among U.S. households will translate into more spending on trips. That included gains of 9.3% for United Airlines, 8% for Delta Air Lines and 7.6% for American Airlines.

2026-02-07 09:28:44,"Stocks rebound after a dramatic week sparked by ongoing AI uncertainty The S&P 500 rose 1.97%, its best day since May as it rebounded from a week of dramatic selling, triggered by fears of how the AI boom will change the economy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-rebound-dramatic-week-sparked-225745288.html,"In this article: ^GSPC ^IXIC AMZN MSFT META Traders work on the floor the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York this week. (Michael Nagle / Bloomberg via Getty Images) · Michael Nagle The S&P 500 on Friday rose 1.97%, recording its best day since May, as it rebounded from a week of dramatic selling triggered yet again by the AI boom and what it will mean for the economy, companies and the labor market. The Nasdaq Composite also surged 2.18% on Friday. But the rebound masked a sell-off in many tech names. Shares of Amazon, the fifth largest public company in the world, sank 5.58% after it said Thursday that it planned to spend $200 billion in the coming year. That money is primarily expected to be spent on the Amazon Web Services division, the largest cloud provider in the world. Since Monday, Amazon's stock has plunged 12% and shed more than $310 billion in market value. Two other tech giants, Microsoft and Meta, have met similar fates this week. Both companies also announced hundreds of billions of dollars in planned spending on AI this year. Collectively, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet plan to shell out around $650 billion this year to expand their data center and AI capabilities. Taken together, the four companies shed nearly $1 trillion in market value over the last five days. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also finished the week in the red. But there were definite bright spots. Industrial stocks such as Caterpillar and a handful of energy firms soared on the expectation that their services would be in high demand for data centers. The industrial and energy sectors of the S&P 500 were two of the best performers on Friday. Tech was as well, boosted by chipmakers. Shares of Nvidia also boomed, rising nearly 8%. The AI chip maker is now worth more than $4.5 trillion. After saying earlier this week that the sell-off was ""the most illogical thing in the world,"" Nvidia CEO went on CNBC to back the sector again on Friday. Huang said the stunning levels of spending was appropriate given the ""incredibly high"" demand for AI applications. Likewise, Apple jumped 7% this week. The iPhone maker has been largely spared from recent AI-induced sell-offs because the company buys most of its cloud computing capacity from other firms, rather than build its own data centers. The turmoil started on Tuesday, after AI developer Anthropic announced that AI agents could do advanced tasks such as data analytics. This triggered a panic among investors in the software companies and firms that provide data analysis for industries as varied as real estate, human resources and banking. Fear that AI agents could eat into their businesses prompted heavy selling this week in the sector. Private credit firms, which own many of the big software and data companies, also plummeted this week. These firms play a growing role in helping to raise the extraordinary amount of money that AI and tech giants are seeking to expand. Story Continues The Dow Jones Industrial Average also hit 50,000 Friday for the the first time ever. While the index and each of all-time highs draw lots of attention, the Dow contains only 30 stocks, making it a relatively poor barometer of the overall strength of the markets, relative to an index like the S&P 500. President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to celebrate the Dow milestone, posting: ""CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA!"" For the year, however, the more representative S&P 500 is up less than 1%. Meanwhile, the value of one bitcoin swung nearly $10,000 in the last 24 hours, with the token plunging nearly to $60,000 late Thursday night. By late Friday, it had boomeranged back to more than $70,000. But crypto can often be an outlier to more mainstream assets such as stocks and bonds. ""Crypto is not an asset, and is held by a tiny portion of society,"" UBS Global Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan wrote on Friday. ""It is unlikely that consumer behavior will change because of recent market moves."" Small and medium stocks also well outperformed their larger peers on Friday, soaring almost 4% on the Russell 2000 index. ""We are long Main St., short Wall St.,"" wrote Bank of America analysts on Friday. They suggested that until Trump's approval rating improves, smaller stocks would continue to benefit.

Shares of school bus company Blue Bird (NASDAQ:BLBD) jumped 5.2% in the afternoon session after the broader market rebounded from a tech-driven sell-off, with investors taking the opportunity to buy stocks at lower prices. This rally was fueled by a recovery in technology stocks and a significant bounce in Bitcoin, which stabilized after losing over half its value from its October peak. Investor sentiment was also lifted by a surprising improvement in U.S. consumer sentiment and the realization that massive AI-related capital expenditure, such as Amazon's planned $200 billion, directly benefits chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom. These ""pick-and-shovel"" winners jumped as much as 7%, helping the S&P 500 edge back into positive territory for 2026. The highlight of the day was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surged and crossed the historic 50,000 threshold for the first time. The shares closed the day at $59.22, up 6.6% from previous close. Is now the time to buy Blue Bird? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free . What Is The Market Telling Us Blue Bird’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 14 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 14.5% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter 2025 results that surpassed analyst expectations on profit and provided an upbeat full-year profit forecast. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.00, comfortably beating the anticipated $0.80. Revenue for the quarter also slightly exceeded forecasts at $333.1 million, a 6.1% increase year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $50.1 million also significantly surpassed estimates. CEO John Wyskiel highlighted that order intake climbed 45% compared to last year, pushing the company's backlog to a seasonally strong level. He also emphasized the company's ability to pass through tariffs and maintain profitability. ""Our Q1 order intake was up 45% from 2025, which pushed our backlog to a seasonally strong 3,400 units,"" Wyskiel stated, reflecting confidence in Blue Bird's positioning despite external pressures. Looking ahead, Blue Bird offered a mixed full-year outlook. While its revenue guidance of $1.5 billion at the midpoint came in slightly below consensus, its adjusted EBITDA forecast of $225 million was ahead of Wall Street's expectations, signaling confidence in its future profitability. Overall, we think this was a decent quarter with some key metrics above expectations. Story Continues Blue Bird is up 26.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $59.22 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $60.86 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Blue Bird’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,534.

Threats of tariffs initially created uncertainty for businesses, as they can lead to higher costs for multinational corporations and disrupt global supply chains.

Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and other “hyperscalers” are in an arms race to invest in AI and beat competitors in a technology that could change vast parts of the economy. Google parent Alphabet Inc. said it’s poised to spend as much as $185 billion on data centers this year, more than it has invested in the past three years combined. Amazon.com Inc. promised an even bigger outlay: $200 billion. Most Read from Bloomberg Canadian Province New Brunswick to Quit Using Elon Musk’s X Chicago Office Tower Sells at an 87% Discount to Pre-Covid Price For These Old Bus Stations, It’s Not the End of the Line Milan Olympics Housing Is Built for Easy Reuse In Praise of Urban Disorder A chunk of those investments will come from the high-grade corporate bond market, potentially resulting in more debt sales this year than investors had expected. But the more tech companies borrow, the greater the potential pressure on bond valuations. The securities are already expensive by historical standards, trading at close to their tightest spreads since the late 1990s. “The AI spending bonanza is finding buyers today but leaves little upside and even less room for error,” said Alexander Morris, chief executive officer and co-founder of F/m Investments. “There is no asset class that can’t and won’t spoil.” Those fears weighed on tech companies’ notes this week, which broadly weakened relative to Treasuries, including most of the $25 billion of debt that Oracle sold on Monday. In the broader market, high-grade corporate bond yield spreads edged about 0.02 percentage point wider this week. Beyond supply and demand, intensifying worries around AI’s power to disrupt have sparked tremors in the market. As companies like Anthropic PBC release a steady stream of tools targeting professional services from finance to software development, investors are starting to price in the threat AI poses to entire businesses. Software companies have seen their leveraged loan prices drop about 4% this year through Thursday, according to Bloomberg index data, amid fears that AI will leave many software products obsolete. Publicly traded lenders known as business development companies also have extensive exposure to software, with the industry accounting for more than 20% of portfolios on average, according to a note from Barclays. A BDC equity index fell 4.6% this week. Story Continues In the high-grade and high-yield bond markets, software companies are comparatively less represented, accounting for around 3% of each, according to Barclays. Still, one factor that makes corporate bonds vulnerable to rising risks is valuations, which remain high even with recent weakening. The average US high-grade corporate bond spread was 0.75 percentage point at Thursday’s close, according to Bloomberg index data. “Tight valuations make credit susceptible to potential disruption,” Barclays strategists Brad Rogoff and Dominique Toublan wrote in a Friday note. JPMorgan Chase & Co. in November forecast about $400 billion of high-grade US bond sales from the technology, media and telecom sector this year. But that figure could climb as companies’ spending plans increase. For all the concerns around looming supply, it’s likely that, for now, current demand for investment-grade bonds is even greater. Money has been chasing deals this year even though spreads remain near their tightest in decades. High-grade technicals — market parlance for the balance between supply and demand as revealed by data like dealer inventories and the cash balances of credit funds — have remained robust despite record-setting issuance in the US and across the globe. Funds that invest in high-grade bonds saw $6.44 billion of inflows in the week ended Feb. 4, according to LSEG Lipper, the biggest inflow in over five years. But as these tech giants ramp up their spending plans and sell more debt to fund their AI projects, technicals should continue to weaken, according to Nathaniel Rosenbaum, head of US credit strategy at JPMorgan. Prone to Shocks New issues over the past 10 days have underperformed the JPMorgan US Liquid Index by 4 basis points, the largest such underperformance since October, Rosenbaum wrote in a note Friday. That’s even as dealer inventories remain near record lows. “To the extent issuance picks back up again over the remainder of the month, as we believe it will, there is room for further technical weakness ahead,” Rosenbaum wrote. It’s possible that investors could swoop in and buy bonds as they become cheaper, shifting from either money market funds or mortgage bonds that have generated big gains, said Andrzej Skiba, head of US fixed income at RBC Global Asset Management’s BlueBay Fixed Income, during a Bloomberg TV interview on Friday. Still, the confluence of tech’s borrowing binge, tight spreads and rising credit risks tied to AI make for a potentially precarious environment for investors — and one easily prone to shocks. “It doesn’t take too many adverse events to create a selloff and for the prices to collapse,” said Ali Meli, founder and CIO of Monachil Capital Partners. “While credit markets may appear very liquid when the markets are good, the buyers can quickly disappear.” WATCH: This week’s guests include JPMorgan Asset Management’s Oksana Aronov, Doubleline Capital’s Deputy Chief Investment Officer Jeff Sherman, Oaktree Capital Management’s Danielle Poli, RBC Global Asset MGMT.

Head of BlueBay Andrzej Skiba Click here for a podcast with H.I.G. on distressed opportunities amid the biggest loan slump in years Week In Review A selloff in software debt has pushed billions of dollars of loans into distressed territory, rapidly repricing a market amid the threat of artificial intelligence disruption. Shares of Wall Street’s largest alternative-investment firms plunged, driven by fears that AI-driven disruptions would cause steep losses on their books. Shares of business development companies also fell amid the selloff. Private equity titans are questioning whether the model of snapping up software-as-a-service companies via debt-fueled buyouts is dead. Pain spread to the loan market as well: A group of banks led by Deutsche Bank AG was unable to sell about $1.2 billion of loans backing the acquisition of a software provider. In Europe, two software companies shelved loan offerings amid rising investor unease around the developments in AI. Credit investors should guard against potential downside risks tied to “AI exuberance” after optimism around the technology helped yield premiums drop to their lowest in decades, according to HSBC Bank strategists. And private credit could see default rates surge to as high as 13% in the US if AI triggers an “aggressive” disruption among corporate borrowers, according to UBS Group AG. Global bond issuance has reached $1 trillion in record time as borrowers seize soaring demand to lock in relatively cheap costs. Tech companies in particular are expected to make up a larger share of supply as quarterly results get released and firms emerge from earnings blackouts. Foreign investors bought American corporate bonds at the fastest monthly pace in nearly three years in January, as stable yields and lower hedging costs boosted the appeal of US credit, JPMorgan Chase & Co. data shows. However, BlackRock Inc.’s Rick Rieder said he’s reducing exposure to US investment-grade and high-yield bonds while increasing holdings of emerging-market debt, citing favorable valuations and a soft dollar. Prison-food vendor TKC Holdings Inc. is seeking to raise more than $2 billion to refinance expensive debt, a deal likely to test appetite from investors who’ve historically shunned the for-profit prisons industry. Bank of America Corp. priced a $7 billion sale of investment-grade bonds, adding to a flurry of offerings by major Wall Street banks. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is readying a revised $3.75 billion financing — now likely to include a junk bond offering — to support chemical maker Arclin Inc.’s acquisition of DuPont de Nemours’ Aramids business. Banks are preparing to sell $3.75 billion in debt to back Stonepeak Partners’ acquisition of a majority stake in BP Plc’s Castrol division. A Cipher Mining Inc. subsidiary is seeking to raise $2 billion in the US junk bond market to help fund construction of a data center tied to Amazon.com Inc. Bankers are working on debt packages of around €2.5 billion ($2.9 billion) to back a potential acquisition of Continental AG’s industrial ContiTech unit. Norinchukin Bank is discussing a capital injection into a joint venture that said its estimated loss from debt linked to First Brands Group has ballooned to almost $1 billion. First Brands founder Patrick James will remain free on a $50 million bond partly secured by a Hamptons home as he awaits trial on fraud charges stemming from the collapse of his auto parts supply business. Thoma Bravo raised the stakes in the fight between private equity firms and their lenders, by deploying a loan provision to help smoke out creditor rebellions before they even begin. Private equity owned Multi-Color Corp. won court approval to start tapping a $250 million Chapter 11 loan, defeating a challenge from rival lenders that floated a competing financing. Lenders to bankrupt restaurant operator FAT Brands Inc. want the chief executive officer suspended without pay over a recent stock sale for its Twin Peaks dining chain, deepening a battle for control of the company as it attempts to restructure. Nearly 18 months after lenders to Pluralsight took over the educational-software business, some of them are booking fresh losses on their investments. Nine Energy Service Inc., a Houston-based oil field vendor, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it struggled with high leverage and a shrinking business amid a slowdown in drilling programs. Hong Kong’s largest developer Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. is seeking a loan of at least HK$5 billion ($640 million), returning to the market after skipping its annual refinancing last year. On the Move Eric Beinstein, head of US credit strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co., is retiring after 40 years at the firm. US high-grade credit strategist Nathaniel Rosenbaum will be taking over as head, Beinstein wrote in his daily note on Wednesday. Miguel Picache, the head of Citigroup Inc.’s private placement business, is retiring after nearly 25 years with the bank. The veteran banker will pursue other interests and spend time in the Philippines, he said in a LinkedIn post. Fortress Investment Group managing directors Morgan McClure and Andrew Robbins, who served on the board of formerly bankrupt Red Lobster after a firm-led takeover of the chain, are set to leave both the board and Fortress. UniCredit SpA has hired close to 20 investment bankers from Banco Santander SA’s former Polish unit as it seeks growth in the country.

2026-02-07 23:28:33,"Should You Buy Uber Stock Now for a ‘Multitrillion-Dollar’ Opportunity in Robotaxis? With management betting big on robotaxis as a future growth engine, should you buy Uber stock now?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-uber-stock-now-multitrillion-163236493.html,"In this article: UBER Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just powering chatbots and cloud software. It’s beginning to drive cars, too. Autonomous vehicles (AVs), which once seemed like a futuristic fantasy, are now steadily becoming part of everyday transportation. Among companies leaning hard into this shift is Uber Technologies (UBER), which is rapidly expanding its robotaxi ambitions. Although Uber’s latest quarterly results disappointed some investors due to an earnings miss, management’s growing focus on autonomy may be the more important story shaping its long-term outlook. On its earnings call, management revealed plans to have robotaxis operating in 15 cities by year-end, underscoring the company's determination to lead in autonomy. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed strong confidence that autonomous vehicles would ultimately benefit the entire mobility sector. He also described robotaxis as a meaningful growth driver in markets where they’re already active, specifically highlighting San Francisco, Atlanta, and Austin, Texas, as early examples of traction.

These 3 Dividend Stocks Combine Income, Momentum, and Upside Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines. For now, autonomous vehicles represent just 0.1% of global rideshare trips, whether on Uber’s platform or elsewhere, a tiny slice of today’s market. But the CEO made it clear he sees something much bigger ahead, emphasizing that AV technology could unlock a “multitrillion-dollar opportunity” for Uber over time. So, with management making such bold long-term bets despite near-term earnings pressure, should investors scoop up Uber shares now? About Uber Stock Since launching in 2010, Uber has become a familiar name in ride-hailing, making it possible to book a trip with just a few taps on a phone. What began in San Francisco has expanded into a global platform, with more than 72 billion trips completed and counting. Over time, the company has broadened its focus beyond rides to include food delivery and freight services. By expanding into multiple areas of transportation and logistics, Uber has become a regular part of how many people move around cities and receive goods. Its platform connects riders, drivers, couriers, and businesses, reflecting how digital services are increasingly shaping everyday urban transportation and delivery networks. And now, Uber is sharpening its focus on getting autonomous vehicles all the way to customers’ doorsteps. Story Continues To make that happen, Uber is leaning into a partnership-driven strategy to expand its robotaxi footprint. Most recently, the company teamed up with EV manufacturer Lucid Group (LCID) and self-driving technology firm Nuro, Inc., with plans to help deploy at least 20,000 robotaxis across global markets, a clear step beyond small-scale trials. Also, the company works with Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Waymo and May Mobility, both active players in autonomous driving. In addition, chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) provides the high-performance computing technology that helps power advanced self-driving systems. Together, these alliances underline Uber's efforts to build a broad network of partners to support its long-term robotaxi expansion. Currently commanding a market capitalization of roughly $155.3 billion, shares of this ride-hailing giant have posted a respectable return of 6.83% over the past year, edging past the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which has climbed almost 14% over the same period. So far in 2026, however, the ride-hailing stock has hit a bump, slipping nearly 8.5%. Much of the recent volatility followed its latest quarterly results, which failed to impress Wall Street. At the same time, investors are also keeping a close eye on rising costs tied to Uber’s long-term push into autonomous vehicle technology, spending that could weigh on near-term profitability even as it aims to power future growth. www.barchart.com A Look Inside Uber’s Q4 Financial Performance When Uber released its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results on Feb. 4, investors got a report that showed strong demand but softer profitability, and the market responded with caution, sending the stock down 5.2% that day. Revenue for the final quarter of 2025 rose a healthy 20% year-over-year (YOY) to $14.37 billion, narrowly topping Wall Street’s $14.34 billion estimate and signaling that activity across Uber’s platform remains robust. Much of that growth was driven by its core segments. The mobility business, which includes ride-hailing, brought in $8.2 billion, up 19% from a year ago, while delivery revenue took an even greater leap of 30% YOY to $4.9 billion. Still, earnings didn’t quite meet expectations. Adjusted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.71, a 27% increase YOY but below the Street’s $0.79 forecast. On a GAAP basis, net income totaled $296 million, a sharp drop from $6.88 billion a year earlier. Results were affected by a $1.6 billion net pre-tax headwind tied to revaluations of equity investments, along with higher taxes and the company’s efforts to offer more affordable rides to grow bookings and attract new users. Operationally, however, momentum remained strong. Total trips surged 22% YOY to 3.8 billion during the quarter, fueled by 18% growth in Monthly Active Platform Consumers. Gross bookings also rose an impressive 22% to $54.1 billion, highlighting continued engagement across the platform. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Uber expects growth to remain solid, forecasting gross bookings of $52 billion to $53.5 billion, which would represent 17% to 21% YOY growth on a constant-currency basis. Furthermore, the company guided for non-GAAP EPS of $0.65 to $0.72, implying 37% YOY growth at the midpoint, along with adjusted EBITDA of $2.37 billion to $2.47 billion. How Are Analysts Viewing Uber Stock? Although investors were less than thrilled with the company’s latest quarterly results, Wall Street’s overall stance on Uber remains firmly optimistic. The stock currently holds a consensus “Strong Buy” rating, suggesting analysts largely see recent weakness as short-term noise rather than a break in the company’s long-term growth trajectory. Out of 51 analysts covering the name, 37 rate it a “Strong Buy,” three recommend a “Moderate Buy,” 10 suggest “Hold,” and just one analyst has a “Strong Sell” rating. The average price target of $107.07 points to roughly 43% upside from current levels, while bullish Street target of $150 implies the shares could surge 100% if Uber’s growth strategy plays out as expected. www.barchart.com www.barchart.com On the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

2026-02-07 23:28:35,"3 Oversold Software Stocks You Should Buy on the Dip Now DOCU, INTU, and TEAM are three oversold software stocks that offer significant upside potential to shareholders in February 2026.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-oversold-software-stocks-buy-163002370.html,"In this article: DOCU INTU TEAM The software sector just took a harder hit than at any point in its history, creating opportunities for investors willing to look past the panic. Jefferies recently noted that roughly 73% of software stocks now screen as oversold, the highest reading on record. Even the broader tech universe isn't far behind, with about 45% of names hitting oversold territory. But here's the thing: three names stand out from the carnage with something most beaten-down stocks don't have. DocuSign (DOCU), Intuit (INTU), and Atlassian (TEAM) all show oversold conditions on their RSI indicators while maintaining perfect 100% Barchart opinion scores.

These 3 Dividend Stocks Combine Income, Momentum, and Upside Get exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else. That's a rare combination, suggesting Wall Street analysts still believe in the fundamentals even as traders hammer the stocks. Let's break down why each deserves a closer look. DocuSign: Agreement Management Is the Real Story DocuSign's stock has taken a beating alongside the broader software selloff, but CFO Blake Grayson made a compelling case at the Nasdaq investor conference in December that most people are missing the bigger picture. The company is building what Grayson called Intelligent Agreement Management, or IAM, which addresses everything from preparing agreements to managing them after signature. It crossed 25,000 IAM customers in the most recent quarter, up from just 10,000 in April. That's serious momentum for a product that launched in mid-2025. Grayson explained that the company already has 150 million consented agreements on the IAM platform, providing a significant data advantage. When DocuSign benchmarked queries on public contract data versus their own consented corpus, they achieved a 15-percentage-point improvement in recall precision. ""If you go to ChatGPT and use these LLMs, they're partially accurate,"" Grayson told the conference. ""A 15-point improvement is super valuable, and it provides even more to the trust component that our customers get from using DocuSign."" The company now has nearly 1.8 million customers and relationships with about 275,000 direct sales customers. Most importantly, customers using IAM are using more e-signature volume, creating a flywheel effect that strengthens both businesses. Story Continues DocuSign raised its dollar net retention from a low of 98% roughly two years ago to 102% currently, driven primarily by retention gains since IAM remains too small to drive meaningful expansion yet. Management sees a clear path to high-single-digit or even double-digit growth as IAM scales and churn continues to improve. Out of the 20 analysts tracking DOCU stock, six give it a consensus “Strong Buy,” and 14 recommend “Hold.” The average DOCU stock price target is $85.12, above the current price of about $46. www.barchart.com Intuit: AI Is Transforming Tax and Financial Services Intuit's consumer platform chief, Mark Notarainni, outlined at the Barclays conference how AI is changing TurboTax and Credit Karma, expanding the addressable market. The company declared itself an AI-driven platform seven years ago, well before ChatGPT made headlines. That early investment is paying off now as AI enables true ""done-for-you"" experiences rather than linear interview processes. TurboTax saw a 12% reduction in tax prep time last year by using AI to personalize the experience and only surface relevant questions. The company expects additional refinements this tax season as it works toward enabling 90% of its products with human intelligence augmented by AI. The assisted tax category represents a massive opportunity. About 88 million Americans still file through assisted methods, creating a $37 billion total addressable market. AI is enabling Intuit to move upmarket by making its experts more efficient, allowing them to serve more customers without being bogged down in mundane tasks. Notarainni said developers are 40% more efficient with AI, enabling the company to build products like business tax much faster than previously possible. On the customer success side, Intuit expects $135 million in efficiency opportunities this year, enabling it to serve more customers. Credit Karma is deploying a fleet of AI agents, including a refund assistant to help users make smarter decisions with tax refunds, a debt assistant that works in the background year-round, and Credit Spark to help Gen Z users improve their credit scores through spending-habit analysis. The platform now has 43 million monthly active users across 140 million members, providing multiple touchpoints to drive engagement beyond the seasonal tax business. Out of the 31 analysts tracking INTU stock, 20 recommend “Strong Buy,” three recommend “Moderate Buy,” seven recommend “Hold,” and one recommends “Strong Sell.” The average INTU stock price target is $800, above the current price of about $435. www.barchart.com Atlassian: Customers Are Voting With Multiyear Commitments Atlassian just crossed $6 billion in annual run rate revenue and delivered its first $1 billion cloud revenue quarter, up 26% year-over-year (YoY). But the real signal came from remaining performance obligations, which grew 44% year over year to $3.8 billion. CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes emphasized on the February earnings call that three consecutive quarters of RPO acceleration indicate customers are making long-term bets on Atlassian's platform, not just buying for 2026. ""Those are tens of thousands of seats signing multiyear deals that are voting on not the platform for 2026 for them in AI, but the platform in '27, '28, and '29,"" Cannon-Brookes explained. Atlassian closed a record number of deals greater than $1 million in annual contract value during the second quarter, nearly doubling year-over-year. The company's Rovo AI platform surpassed 5 million monthly active users, with more than 1,000 customers upgrading to the Teamwork Collection and purchasing over 1 million seats. The data shows AI is actually driving more Jira usage, not replacing it. Software teams using AI code-generation tools create 5% more tasks, have 5% more monthly active users, and expand Jira seats 5% faster than those not using AI code-generation tools. Cloud net revenue retention ticked up to 120% for the third straight quarter, showing existing customers are expanding commitments even in a tough environment. Out of the 28 analysts tracking TEAM stock, 20 recommend “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” and seven recommend “Hold.” The average TEAM stock price target is $217.40, above the current price of about $98. www.barchart.com The Bottom Line Software valuations remain elevated at roughly eight times sales, so this isn't a sector-wide buying opportunity. But these three names combine technical oversold conditions with strong analyst support and improving fundamentals, suggesting the selloff created real value. The key is distinguishing between stocks that are cheap for a reason and those where fear has disconnected price from business reality.

2026-02-07 23:28:37,"Netflix dominates streaming. No wonder it’s trying to redefine the market As Chairman Mike Lee put it, Netflix could become “the one platform to rule them all” if the merger is allowed to happen.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-dominates-streaming-no-wonder-155801521.html,"In this article: NFLX This week the Senate Judiciary subcommittee responsible for antitrust issues held a hearing on the proposed merger between Netflix and Warner Brothers Discovery . The Monopoly Man in attendance embodied the concern that was top of mind for every committee member: Netflix is already the dominant player in subscription video-on-demand, and its acquisition of Warner Bros. could cement its unrivaled monopoly. As Chairman Mike Lee put it, Netflix could become “the one platform to rule them all” if the merger is allowed to happen. This outcome would harm both consumers of streaming services as well as the talent that generates such compelling content. Not surprisingly, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos tried to deflate concerns by casting a sprawling definition of the relevant market in which Netflix competes. His prepared remarks mention YouTube , Netflix’s purported rival, 25 times. “Including YouTube and the like, Netflix accounts for less than 10% of TV viewing,” Mr. Sarandos insisted. Bruce Campbell, Chief Revenue and Strategy Officer for Warner Bros., added that Netflix competes against short form user-generated content, like TikTok and Instagram . It shouldn’t require an antitrust economist to understand why their comparisons to ad-supported, amateur-produced content are misleading. But here goes one anyway. Just because two services compete for viewers’ attention does not imply that they are in the same antitrust market. If policymakers included all things that vie for viewers’ attention, they would have to include gorgeous sunsets alongside Netflix, YouTube and TikTok in one massive attention market. To define the contours of a market, the courts rely on a hypothetical monopolist test. This test considers whether a single seller of a defined set of products could profitably raise prices of those products by a small but significant amount (called a “SSNIP”) above competitive levels. When performed in merger review, the test is applied initially over the smallest set of products offered by the merging parties. Applied here, one might ask, could a subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) provider raise its prices beyond competitive levels without shedding too many viewers. If yes, then a relevant antitrust market exists, as that provider enjoys pricing power. If not, the market would be expanded to include nearby substitutes, with the test repeated until a profitable price hike is achieved. Evidence suggests Netflix already enjoys substantial pricing power. It has been able to increase the cost of its standard and premium packages by 29% and 39% , respectively, since 2020, while still continuing to amass more viewers. Netflix also charges a price premium relative to its peers, which further indicates power. If it were constrained by user-generated platforms, as the merger proponents would have you believe, then subscribers would cancel their subscriptions in favor of YouTube or TikTok. Yet they haven’t. Story Continues Mr. Sarandos’s and Mr. Campbell’s stories about competing with user-generated platforms don’t pass a sniff test either. Content on YouTube, for example, is overwhelmingly produced by amateur creators—which is a major factor in why such videos are generally free or ad-supported. By contrast, Netflix invests significantly in high-quality content. It plans to spend as much as $20 billion this year . Think of it this way: When a family sits down to movie night, they are not flipping to YouTube. Conversely, when they want a DIY tutorial or a clip of a cat playing piano, they are not opening Netflix. Under a reasonable definition of the SVOD market, Netflix’s market dominance is impossible to ignore. It currently has about a third of all streaming subscribers worldwide. The addition of Warner Bros.’ HBO Max, which controls another 13%, would create a streaming giant with nearly half of all SVOD subscribers. Mix in Warner’s vast content catalogue, and users would essentially have to keep their subscription to access mainstream movies and films. Smaller streamers would likely have to consolidate just to keep up, kicking off a snowball effect in the market. Several lawmakers raised the point that such control would give Netflix immense power to push an ideological agenda. While the debate over Netflix’s “wokeism” at the hearing might be ancillary to traditional antitrust concerns, it warrants consideration whether any one company should have that kind of unilateral control over what content viewers receive. As Mr. Sarandos and Mr. Campbell both pointed out, entertainment shapes culture. Netflix is the number one SVOD provider, with 325 million subscribers globally. Warner Bros., with 125 million subscribers, is the fourth largest. Putting these two giant streaming services under one roof is the epitome of a horizontal merger that would hurt consumers. It would confer significant power to raise prices and stifle competition. No amount of CEO spin can change those basic facts. The question now turns to whether Trump’s antitrust enforcers will buy what Netflix is selling, and if not, how the Warner Bros. board will respond?

But as early signals suggest the cycle may finally be inflecting upward, recent earnings calls from RXO and C.H. Robinson offer a timely warning: a rising market does not automatically mean an easier one. In fact, the transition phase may be where financial and operational stress becomes most acute. RXO’s fourth-quarter results showed just how fragile broker economics remain. The company pointed to continued pricing pressure, margin compression and the challenge of balancing carrier costs against still-cautious shipper demand. FreightWaves’ John Kingston writes, “Those various results show what happens when the freight market suddenly gets stronger, as it did in the last four to five weeks of the quarter, and 3PLs face the reality of filling earlier booked capacity with higher-priced truckload rates.” Brokers often struggle most not at the bottom of the cycle, but as it begins to move. RXO’s commentary fits that pattern. Capacity remains readily available in many lanes, but it is no longer uniformly cheap. Spot rates can move quickly, contract rates lag behind, and brokers caught between the two are forced to make uncomfortable decisions about margin sacrifice versus customer retention. That tension is likely to intensify as 2026 unfolds. Where Brokers Feel the Pressure First One of the clearest risks in an upward-inflating market is working capital strain. As carrier rates firm faster than shipper pricing, brokers are asked to float higher payments while waiting for contractual adjustments to catch up. For large, well-capitalized players, this is manageable. RXO acknowledged this dynamic indirectly, emphasizing discipline around pricing and lane selection. The message was subtle but important: not all freight is worth chasing in a turn. Growth without margin is still just risk. As reported in RXO’s fourth quarter call, “The bottom line GAAP net loss was $46 million in the fourth quarter. That was more than a $25 million GAAP net loss in the fourth quarter of 2024, and $14 million in the third quarter.” SONAR. Spot (linehaul) to contract rate spread Another stress point is operational. Rising volatility rewards brokers with strong carrier relationships and real-time visibility into lane-level pricing. Those relying too heavily on static models or national averages are more likely to misprice freight and pay for it later. Why C.H. Robinson Looks Different The contrast with C.H. Robinson is revealing. Despite ongoing headwinds, Robinson’s earnings calls struck a notably different tone. While management acknowledged the tough environment, the company highlighted productivity gains, cost discipline and improved execution. The market responded accordingly, sending the stock higher even as freight fundamentals remained mixed. Story Continues C.H. Robinson, CFO  Damon Lee said the North American Surfact Transport group is “still on a very good trajectory to get to that 40% target. We’ll make an earnings growth and quality of earnings growth decision on whether we continue to expand margins at that point, or whether we reinvest that into demonstrable growth.” The difference is not simply scale, though scale helps. Robinson has spent the downturn restructuring operations, investing in technology and reducing headcount to better align with demand. That has given it flexibility heading into a turn, the ability to absorb short-term margin pressure without losing strategic footing. XEO of C.H. Robinson, Dave Bozeman said, “There could be a ‘shift’ in the headcount, because we are shifting to a more customer-focused and automating largely through AI processes that have a lot of friction and a lot of entry-level headcount. And for some of that, we’re not backfilling.” What Brokers Should Be Watching Now As signals of recovery build, brokers would be wise to focus less on headline rate increases and more on the mechanics underneath them. Lane-by-lane volatility, customer mix and carrier loyalty will matter more than broad market direction. Equally important is credit exposure. Shippers slow to adjust rates upward may also be slow to pay, compounding cash flow challenges. Brokers who tighten credit terms or proactively manage receivables may find themselves better positioned when conditions tighten further. Finally, the RXO and Robinson results both point to a hard truth: the market’s next phase will reward execution, not optimism. The easy money of past upcycles is unlikely to return in the same form.

2026-02-07 23:28:42,"​​The Two Minutes That Made Traders Lose Faith in the Gas Market During a record-breaking surge in gas futures on Jan. 27, the New York Mercantile Exchange imposed an extraordinary 2-minute trading halt during the market close that skewed the settlement price and confounded traders already exercised over a demand outlook that had been upended by cold weather.  The market pause, which should have lasted only five seconds, was the ninth circuit breaker triggered in the past day.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/two-minutes-made-traders-lose-130007026.html,"In this article: CME NG=F BGC (Bloomberg) -- More than a week after an extreme bout of volatility roiled the US natural gas market, traders are still fuming over a glitch they say sowed chaos in a key commodity market. Most Read from Bloomberg Canadian Province New Brunswick to Quit Using Elon Musk’s X Chicago Office Tower Sells at an 87% Discount to Pre-Covid Price For These Old Bus Stations, It’s Not the End of the Line Milan Olympics Housing Is Built for Easy Reuse In Praise of Urban Disorder During a record-breaking surge in gas futures on Jan. 27, the New York Mercantile Exchange imposed an extraordinary 2-minute trading halt during the market close that skewed the settlement price and confounded traders already exercised over a demand outlook that had been upended by cold weather. The market pause, which should have lasted only five seconds, was the ninth circuit breaker triggered in the past day. ""Something clearly did not operate the way that it should have that day and it is highly likely it impacted the day’s economics,"" George Cultraro, Head of Global Commodities Trading at Bank of America said in an interview. For some investors the incident meant losses, while others were left with concern about the integrity of the market, according to interviews with 10 traders. The CME Group Inc., which owns Nymex, informed traders that a “technical error” had caused the circuit breaker to last longer than the usual five seconds. But for many investors, the incident was emblematic of a market plagued with issues. Natural gas has grown extremely volatile as US liquefied natural gas exports and the artificial intelligence boom supercharge demand. Futures prices had surged 119% during Jan. 20-26, a 35-year record for the period, before logging the biggest single-day crash on a percentage basis in 30 years the following week. Now, investors are demanding answers from CME, as well as from regulators. What caused the glitch? What recourse do they have to recoup losses? And haven’t the powers-that-be noticed that pervasive illiquidity heading into contract expiration can cause wild price swings that short-circuit the exchange’s market mechanism? CME said in a statement that it has addressed the technical issue behind the circuit breaker but declined to comment on the reasons for the malfunction, or its impact on investors. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said that market moves, and thus the circuit breakers, appeared to be “consistent with recent supply and demand fluctuation.” The agency added that it’s “continuing to evaluate related trading activity.” Story Continues Lottery Ticket Losses The chaos stemming from the mishap rippled beyond gas  futures. In the options market leading up to that day, tens of thousands of “lottery- ticket” bets had been placed on gas ending the day above $7 per British thermal units. If those positions remained open and had settled at $7.20 (as suggested by the bids and offers during the halt,) the play could have yielded a $40 million jackpot for a bet that in mid-January was nearly worthless. The window for a win was extremely narrow but, heading into the close, odds were good. Prices had crashed through the $7 level and then furiously rallied to $7.31 with 68 seconds to go before the end of the settlement period. Then came the circuit breaker. Though investors were flying blind, bids and offers continued to stream in which, if executed, would have driven the price to $7.40, according to traders. But because the trading halt lasted so long – only lifting after the market close – those transactions weren’t fulfilled. The settlement price posted at $6.95, rendering the lottery ticket options worthless. CME declined to share data on how many positions remained open at the close. “The exchange having a pause during options expiry was quite absurd,” said Bill Perkins, founder of Skylar Capital. “That caused a lot of issues for market participants which are still being worked through.” At least one investor caught out by the incident — and who asked not to be named discussing private matters — complained to CME and said the agency advised filing a complaint to seek recovery of losses. But because it would be difficult to prove what would have happened during those two minutes had trading not frozen, the investor said recouping anything would be unlikely. ‘Banging the Close’ While the errant circuit breaker was a key disruptor on Jan. 27, the frequency of the halts point to another issue with the market: pervasively low liquidity as contracts near expiration. When a market is illiquid, virtually any activity can touch off outsized price moves. And when those swings are concentrated during the settlement window, they can move other markets in unpredictable ways. ""Natural gas futures are far more than a mere financial instrument,” said Adam Sinn, CEO of hedge fund Aspire Commodities. “They are a physical product that benchmark pricing for natural gas consumers, as well as setting the monthly electricity contract prices which determines Americans’ energy bills. The importance of the settlement being a legitimate process cannot be understated.” In any energy market, liquidity tends to decline heading into expiry as traders roll from one contract to the next. But traders say that, in gas, regulatory caps on the number of contracts a trader can hold are particularly hampering. Although the size of the market has ballooned, so-called position limits constrain participation because smaller traders often can’t meet the requirements. That gives large, well-capitalized speculators, like hedge funds, an outsized influence on market moves when liquidity dries up. The irony is that, while the position limits in CME are meant to guard against malfeasance, illiquidity can facilitate a type of manipulation called “banging the close,” in which a party concentrates a large volume of their trades during the settlement window to move the closing price in a particular direction. Aspire’s Sinn said this could be one explanation for gas’s moves on Jan. 27. “CFTC limits are arbitrarily reducing liquidity and that creates more volatility,” Perkins said. “To fix the liquidity issue we need to get rid of limits entirely or at least revise them."" At the same time, Intercontinental Exchange, called ICE, has become the platform of choice for physical US gas traders. The spread between prices on ICE and CME has widened – swelling last week to the biggest differential on record, according to traders. The widening spread would affect money managers and producers that use Nymex futures to hedge against price fluctuations, potentially resulting in losses, four traders said. Not a One-Off The market was already primed for chaos in the days leading up to Jan. 27, as forecasts abruptly shifted from milder-than-normal weather to a deep freeze across much of the country. That sent futures surging. As the cold knocked out gas production, prices rose even higher. That it all occurred as traders were rolling from the February contract to March only exacerbated the swings. It could all happen again, warned Perkins. Barring any changes to how the market operates, another cold snap could trigger a similar explosion at settlement. “A great deal of market participants have not seen price volatility like this since the 2014 winter and its extreme gyrations,” said Campbell Faulkner, senior vice president at brokerage BGC Group Inc. “All of this has combined to create an environment that has reminded people of the danger and difficulty of trading natural gas."" --With assistance from Devika Krishna Kumar, David Marino and Nicola M White.

Their list of tricky talking points just got a new addition — the so-called SaaSpocalypse.

It also spilled over to private-credit and alternative asset managers, many of whom were out in force at the event. However, evangelists of private markets pitching their products to Europe’s affluent had a different message: Nothing to see here. Meanwhile, investors fretted about the money managers’ exposure to those software companies. KKR & Co. ended the week almost 10% lower, while Ares Management Corp. dropped 12.8% even after the firms reported solid results. Both companies, together with peers Blackstone Inc., and EQT AB, are sitting on double-digit declines since the start of January. The jitters back home in London and New York pose a new challenge for private-market players who are already under scrutiny from regulators around the world. Policymakers in the US, European Union and Australia have been pushing for more transparency in private markets as they assess financial stability and contagion risks. While the stock plunge tests the ability of private-market advocates to pitch their funds to wealth clients and exposes their need to sharpen their marketing scripts, the tone at the IPEM conference — and outside — was broadly optimistic. Panelists including Ares’ head of investment strategy, Brendan McCurdy, discussed how to make alternatives a more central part of portfolios at the IPEM event on Feb. 5. At the same time, McCurdy’s boss and Ares Chief Executive Officer Michael Arougheti faced the task of addressing the company’s plunging share price as he unveiled results in New York. Markets are “missing the point” that loans are safe, Arougheti said in a Bloomberg Television interview Thursday. “That’s why I work in private markets, the markets trade on momentum, there’s a lot of forces in the public markets that are not tethered to fundamentals.” Story Continues The AI turbulence was front and center for KKR too, with the first analyst question on the company’s earnings call on Feb. 5 immediately addressing the “elephant in the room.” Co-Chief Executive Officer Scott Nuttall sought to assuage concerns, noting that only about 7% of its $744 billion of assets under management is exposed to software, a concentration well below industry levels. “We tell people here that they’ve got to focus on things they can control, short-term trading of our stock is not one of them,” KKR Chief Financial Officer Robert Lewin said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “We feel really good about our exposure. This isn’t something that has become front of mind in the past couple of days, this is something we have been thinking about for a number of years.” Won’t End Well Those reassurances aren’t likely to silence long-time critics who have been flagging the risks of opening private-market products to a broader and less sophisticated audience. The rush of money from everyday investors is “not going to end well,” 26north Partners founder and former Apollo co-founder Josh Harris said at a separate event this week. “People don’t understand the duration,” Harris said Tuesday at a Wall Street Journal conference. “They don’t understand that some of these structures may not be liquid when things go wrong — and that’s exactly when they need the money.” Such warnings and the latest market gyrations threaten to compound the pressure that’s gradually been building on the amped-up scores of private fund sales teams sipping champagne in the hotel bars along Cannes’ boulevard de la Croissette. More than 130 private market funds were launched over the past two years, after the European Commission overhauled rules for so-called Eltifs, short for European Long-Term Investment Fund. But asset managers have so far largely refrained from disclosing how much the vehicles have raised while they continue to work on building out their distribution channels. Growing pains are also being felt at relatively new private-markets players such as BlackRock Inc., which last year halted a plan to launch an infrastructure Eltif. Assets in open-ended vehicles, which offer investors the chance to withdraw some of their money — unless there’s a stampede for the exit — nearly quadrupled to €9 billion ($10.6 billion) in Europe from the beginning of 2024 through the end of September last year, according to Novantigo. The research and consulting firm estimates that Eltifs’ overall assets could reach more than €180 billion by the end of the decade, up from €29 billion currently. Europe’s fragmented regulatory landscape is a factor and has forced private fund giants including Blackstone, Apollo and KKR to go on a drive to educate intermediaries as they seek partners that can help sell their products to wealthy investors in countries across the continent. “Education is crucial to what we do,” said Farhad Karim, chief operating officer of Blackstone Private Wealth, speaking broadly of private markets. “When headlines move faster than fundamentals, the most important thing we can offer is transparency. When you do that, the picture often looks quite different from the narrative. Facts matter.” Private-market products haven’t yet taken off in Europe in marked contrast to the US, where adoption has been more widespread. For example, an Eltif doesn’t require a minimum investment, making it more accessible to retail investors. But many managers typically still ask fund buyers to stump up at least €10,000. Fees also tend to be far higher than what publicly traded funds charge, given the work involved in sourcing and executing deals. “This is a bit of a chicken and egg situation,” said Mara Dobrescu, a senior principal at research firm Morningstar Inc. Investment platforms have been slow in onboarding retail-oriented evergreen funds in Europe, citing operational complexity because these vehicles involve different notice periods, fee structures, redemption terms, and gating mechanisms, she said. At the same time, retail investors “haven’t exactly been clamoring” for these products either, she added. Structures like Eltifs are “fairly new and unfamiliar, and the lack of a track-record makes it difficult to know what to expect,” Dobrescu said. Race for Exit Market observers regularly warn that evergreen funds will have to restrict withdrawals when markets get choppy. That’s in part because individual investors can be more prone to a race for the exit at times of turbulence. The Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust is among the industry’s most recent and prominent examples. After a rapid rise in interest rates three years ago spooked investors who feared property values would fall, Blackstone was forced to limit withdrawals. Analysts and traders, meanwhile, are assessing the durability of private credit, a cornerstone of the products that private markets firms are racing to sell to wealth clients. A BlackRock private debt fund said last month that it expects to mark down the net value of its assets in part because of its exposure to e-commerce aggregators. Investors from one of Blue Owl Capital Inc.’s tech-focused funds pulled about 15.4% of net assets. IPEM’s organizers, for what it’s worth, seem to be acutely aware of the risks their industry is facing. In the event’s main brochure, the hosts liken private capital managers’ push into retail to a “gold rush” where “excitement is high” and competition fierce. “As the tide rises, we have a collective responsibility to remain disciplined and aligned to determine whether the industry stays on top — or is pulled under.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Cardholders Are Mad at Bilt’s CEO.

But both bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and gold ( GC=F ), the modern and traditional ""stores of value,"" had even wilder runs, falling around 20% and 7%, respectively. Both, like stocks, got some of their gains back. Those big numbers, especially for gold, highlight a truth investors are learning to reckon with: Stores of value just aren't what they used to be. Particularly for gold, a millennia-old store of wealth, which is seeing its classical role upended by volatility. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Subscribe In a sense, it's positive — if you own gold. Prices are up for the week, sitting at just under $5,000. They've risen about 14% so far this year. And there's a good chance we'll see it rise more. JPMorgan analysts, for instance, have doubled down on gold, forecasting demand from central banks and investors to push prices to $6,300 per ounce by the end of the year. That would mark a roughly 25% increase. Read more: Thinking of buying gold? Here's what investors should watch for. Geopolitical instability, the ""debasement"" of fiat currencies , and unresolved questions over debt loads have fueled gold's historic rise. A weakened insert-your-asset-of-choice has encouraged investors to cling to hard assets. Gains though they are, they reflect some wild, meme-stocky numbers that at least somewhat diminish gold's utility as a place to park value. Because, as we all know, what goes up that fast can also go down that fast. The crash earlier in the week punctuated what one expert described as a ""breathtaking and profoundly scary"" rise in precious metals . The price action created charts that looked like they belonged to stocks. Analysts could explain the moves behind the volatility , but some investors decided to just wait it out. Others, seizing the moment, both in the immediate sense and in our larger cultural shift toward casino-like amusements, bought the dip. An uncomfortable idea surrounding safe-haven assets is to think about the economic and political conditions required for their success. If you hold any crypto, though, you may not want to think too deeply about anything right now. Gold bars are displayed in a photo illustration, reflecting recent movements in gold prices driven by inflation concerns and central bank policy outlooks. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) · NurPhoto via Getty Images The comeback in stocks and gold's staggering climb make for a painful contrast . Bitcoin prices fell as low as $61,000 on Thursday. And even with a recovery on Friday to $70,000, the top digital currency is down about 44% from its October peak. Story Continues Crypto evangelists may have pitched bitcoin as 21st-century digital gold. But the new gold isn't bitcoin — it's just more volatile gold. Amid all this, the dollar , for all its movement, looks stable in comparison. If you're looking for stable value, there are probably places and moments to find it.

Learn more about money market account rates today.",https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/best-money-market-account-rates-today-saturday-february-7-2026-110017594.html,"Find out how much you could earn with today’s money market account rates . Deposit interest rates (including money market account rates) have been falling over the past two years. That's why it’s more important than ever to compare MMA rates and ensure you earn as much as possible on your balance. Overview of money market account rates today The national average money market account rate stands at 0.56%, according to the FDIC. This might not seem like much, but consider that four years ago, it was just 0.07%. So by historical standards, money market account rates are still quite high. Even so, some of the top accounts are currently offering over 4% APY. Since these rates may not be around much longer, consider opening a money market account now to take advantage of today’s high rates. Here’s a look at some of the top MMA rates available today: Additionally, the table below features some of the best savings and money market account rates available today from our verified partners. How much will $10,000 make in a money market account? The amount of interest you can earn from a money market account depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (money market account interest typically compounds daily). Say you put $10,000 in an MMA at the average interest rate of 0.56% with daily compounding. At the end of one year, your balance would grow to $10,056.16 — your initial $10,000 deposit, plus $56.16 in interest. Now let’s say you choose a high-yield money market account that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $10,408.08 over the same period, which includes $408.08 in interest. Frequently asked questions about money market account rates What is the downside of a money market account? Compared to a traditional savings account, a money market account may come with more restrictions. For example, money market accounts often require a higher minimum balance in order to earn the best interest rate and/or avoid fees. Certain MMAs may also limit the number of withdrawals you can make per month (typically six). Which bank gives 7% interest on savings accounts? In general, there are no banks that offer a 7% interest rate on money market accounts or any other type of deposit account. That said, you may be able to find local banks and credit unions running limited-time promotional rates on certain accounts, which could be as high as 7%. However, promotional rates at this level often apply to a limited balance. Read more: Do 7% interest savings accounts exist anymore?
