Pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts Alternatives to high-yield savings accounts Overview of today's high-yield savings account rates Tips for finding the best high-yield savings account How to open a high-yield savings account HYSA frequently asked questions (FAQs) Why should I open a savings account? Opening a savings account is a smart financial move. For one, these accounts provide a safe place to store your money while earning interest, helping your savings grow over time. Plus, unlike keeping cash on hand or in a checking account, a savings account encourages financial discipline by separating money meant for future goals from everyday spending. And as long as you open an account with a reputable, federally insured bank or credit union, your deposits are protected in case the financial institution fails — up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, per ownership category. Learn more: 6 benefits of opening a savings account you shouldn't overlook What is a high-yield savings account? A high-yield savings account functions similarly to a traditional savings account. The main difference is that HYSAs offer much higher interest rates. In fact, some of the best HYSAs offer annual percentage yields (APYs) 10 times higher than the national average savings account rate . Keep in mind that some banks may require you to maintain a minimum balance to earn interest or avoid a monthly service charge. However, there are plenty of accounts that offer the same rate regardless of your balance and do not charge monthly fees. When shopping around for an HYSA, it's important to compare multiple offers and select an account that fits your needs. Learn more: High-yield savings account vs. traditional savings account: Which one is better? What is APY? A high-yield savings account’s interest rate represents how much you’ll earn in simple interest. On the other hand, the annual percentage yield (APY) is the rate of return including compound interest, which is the interest you earn on both the principal balance and interest you've accrued previously. Most savings accounts compound interest daily or monthly. The more often interest compounds, the faster your money will grow. HYSAs come with variable interest rates. That means your bank or credit union can change your APY at any time. Generally, APYs increase when the economy is doing well, and the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark rate. Conversely, rates can drop when the economy weakens, and the Fed lowers rates. Learn more: What is compound interest, and how is it calculated? What is a good savings account rate? Because savings account rates fluctuate, what is considered a ""good"" rate can change over time. Generally, a savings account that earns more than the national average is considered good. Today, the national average rate is just 0.39%, while the top high-yield savings accounts offer around 3% to 4% APY. Learn more: What is a good savings account interest rate? Do you pay taxes on high-yield savings accounts? Yes, the interest earned in an HYSA is taxable income . You should receive a Form 1099-INT from your bank if you earn more than $10 in interest during the year, which you need to report on your tax return. However, even if you don't receive this form, you are responsible for reporting all interest income to the IRS. Learn more: How to avoid taxes on savings account interest Pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts There are many benefits of opening a high-yield savings account, particularly the opportunity to earn a competitive rate on your balance. However, there are some drawbacks to consider as well. Let’s take a closer look at the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts : Pros: Higher interest rates: You’ll generally earn more interest than you would with a traditional savings account. Compound interest: Compounding interest helps your balance grow more quickly. Interest in an HYSA may compound daily or monthly. Accessibility: These accounts are a great place to stash money you may need to access quickly, such as your emergency fund. Other types of accounts, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), offer high rates but impose penalties if you withdraw money prior to the maturity date. Minimal or no fees: Fees with high-yield savings accounts are rare, so you won’t need to worry about these costs eating into your balance. Low-risk: High-yield savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Plus, unlike investments, account performance isn’t tied to the stock market and you can’t lose money, making HYSAs a low-risk option for your money. Cons: Variable rates: Your savings account’s APY can increase or decrease over time. While individual banks set rates at their discretion, these rates are loosely tied to the federal funds rate. Banks may choose to increase or decrease savings rates when the Fed adjusts its target rate. Minimum balance requirement: Some accounts may have a high minimum opening deposit. Tiered APYs: Some banks may have tiered APYs depending on the deposit amount. For instance, you may earn a higher rate if you deposit $5,000 vs. $100. So, while a $5,000 deposit isn’t necessarily required, it could result in a better APY. Better for short-term savings: High-yield savings accounts aren’t the best choice for long-term savings goals, like retirement. Investment accounts tend to offer higher long-term returns. Withdrawal limits may apply: Depending on your bank, you may have a limit on monthly withdrawals. Read more: Understanding the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts Alternatives to high-yield savings accounts An HYSA can be a smart place to store your savings, but it's not your only option. Here's a look at some of the alternatives you may want to consider. Money market accounts Money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts both offer higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts. However, these accounts come with different features. For instance, MMAs typically offer check-writing abilities and debit cards, though they might require higher minimum balances to earn the top interest rates. High-yield savings accounts, on the other hand, are designed to store your savings longer-term with fewer withdrawal options. Learn more about money market accounts vs. high-yield savings accounts . CDs Like high-yield savings accounts, CDs can provide a safe place to store your savings while earning a competitive return. The big difference is that CDs require you to lock in your money for a set period, known as the term, which can range from a few months to several years. For this reason, CDs are a better option for people who don't need immediate access to their funds. Learn more about high-yield savings accounts vs. CDs . Investing High-yield savings accounts and investing serve vastly different financial goals and risk profiles. HYSAs provide stable, low-risk returns with interest rates higher than traditional savings accounts. They're best for short-term financial goals or emergency funds due to their liquidity and FDIC insurance. Investing in bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and other securities typically involves higher risk — but also the potential for higher returns over the long run. Investing your money makes more sense for long-term financial goals like retirement since the returns generally outpace inflation and help grow wealth over time. Learn more about high-yield savings accounts vs. investing . Overview of today's high-yield savings account rates Today, savings accounts offer competitive rates by historical standards. Even though the national average rate for traditional savings accounts is just 0.39%, the best high-yield savings accounts still pay upwards of 4% APY. Over the past decade, savings account interest rates have experienced significant fluctuations. In the mid-2010s, rates were considerably low — below 1% — thanks to the Federal Reserve's efforts to stimulate economic growth following the 2008 financial crisis. As the economy recovered, the Fed incrementally increased the federal funds rate between 2015 and 2018, leading to a gradual rise in savings account rates. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 prompted a return to near-zero interest rates to support economic activity, resulting in a decline in savings yields. However, this led to a period of rising inflation, so the Fed implemented several rate hikes, contributing to the current higher yields on savings accounts. Even so, rates are now back on a downward trend as the Fed began cutting its target rate again in late 2024. Tips for finding the best high-yield savings account Competitive rates are great, but considering other factors besides APY can help you find an account that best meets your needs. New account offers: Look at high-yield savings account offers for new depositors with high APYs, low to no account fees, and are free to open. High savings account rates will earn you more interest, but the financial institution offering those rates might not necessarily be the best option for your finances, so do your research before opening an account. Required deposits: Research applicable deposit requirements. Is there a minimum initial deposit requirement? Do any other deposit requirements apply? Are there tiered APYs depending on your deposit amount? Fees: Some accounts may have monthly maintenance fees or other fees. Look into which fees may apply before opening a new account. Accessibility: Understand how you can access your money before opening a new account. For example, can you log into an online dashboard? Does your bank have a mobile app? Is it connected to an ATM network? Deposit options: Review available deposit options. Are mobile check deposits via a mobile banking app an option? Can you make direct deposits via an ATM? Account linking: Look into whether you can link your new account to an existing checking account at another bank. Make sure there are no restrictions or waiting periods when it comes to accessing your money. Learn more: How to choose the right high-yield savings account for you . How to open a high-yield savings account Once you’ve determined the best high-yield savings account for you, opening one is simple and can be done in person or online. You’ll generally need to provide your personal information, proof of identity, and address to open a new account. Make sure you have your driver’s license, Social Security number, and copies of a recent mortgage statement or utility bill. Depending on the account, a minimum deposit amount could apply when you open your HYSA account. If that’s the case, you’ll also need to be ready to transfer money from an existing account to meet the deposit requirement. Learn more: How to open a high-yield savings account Frequently asked questions about high-yield savings accounts Is your money safe in a HYSA?

There’s been no single cause, like there was last April when President Donald Trump’s trade war sent markets into a fearful tailspin. Instead, it’s been a slow drumbeat of news that is sowing anxiety about valuations that many suspected had already run up too far — and causing investors to pull back all at once.

He speaks on “Bloomberg The Close.”Source: Bloomberg That was clear again on Thursday, when the S&P 500 slid 1.2%, its third straight daily decline, and the Nasdaq 100 extended its deepest slide since April. Software stocks extended their tumble after artificial-intelligence startup Anthropic rolled out a new model that’s designed to carry out financial research, the second time this week the company has jolted markets, underscoring the competitive threat from the new technology. Silver — which had tracked gold to record highs — cratered 20%. Bitcoin dropped more than 13%, erasing all of the gains seen since Trump’s election 15 months ago, as investors unwound money-losing trades financed with borrowed money. US Treasuries rallied, resuming their usual role as a haven of last resort. And after the closing bell, Amazon.com Inc. plunged more than 11% when it said it plans to invest $200 billion this year, far more than the amount forecast by analysts who’ve grown increasingly concerned that tech companies are overspending on AI. Those jitters spilled into Asian markets on Friday, with South Korean stocks sinking over 5% at one point and chipmakers Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. among the biggest drags. European stocks slid and Nasdaq 100 Index futures fell 0.4%. “People are definitely going more defensive,” said Brian Frank, president and portfolio manager at Frank Funds. “It’s more of like a shoot first and ask questions later type environment. The recent activity marks a strong shift from the mood on Wall Street heading into the year, when strategists were predicting that stocks were poised for the longest winning streak in nearly two decades. The forecasts rested on expectations that the AI boom would continue, the surprisingly resilient economy would keep bolstering corporate profits and that the Federal Reserve would dial down interest rates. Story Continues That outlook remains largely in place, as evidenced by the solid earnings reports that have been rolling out in recent weeks. But there’s also been a renewed focus on some of the mounting risks: The companies that will be displaced by the AI boom; questions about the direction of the Fed if Trump’s pick, Kevin Warsh, is confirmed as Jerome Powell’s replacement as chair; and stretched valuations — on assets like gold, Bitcoin, or even tech giants like Alphabet Inc. — that may not be sustainable in the long run. Fresh labor-market data also added to the pressure on markets Thursday. New figures from Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. showed companies announced the largest number of job cuts for any January since the depths of the Great Recession in 2009, adding to concerns that economic momentum may be starting to crack. The reversal was most dramatic for Bitcoin. After a meteoric rise for much of last year as Trump’s victory set off a speculative rush into cryptocurrencies, the market for such tokens has tumbled sharply this month as investors yanked out cash. On Thursday, the selloff in Bitcoin deepened as the trading day wore on, dragging down other tokens, exchange-traded funds and the treasury companies like Strategy Inc. that hold vast sums of coins. By late afternoon in New York, it had slumped 13% to just over $63,000, wiping out roughly half its value since it hit a record high four months ago. “The fear and uncertainty across the market is evident,” said Chris Newhouse, head of business development at Ergonia. In the stock market, the drop was more subdued. Yet the pressure was broad based, with nine of 11 major industry groups in the S&P 500 retreating. In addition to the worries about which companies will wind up on the losing end of AI technology, investors have been worried about whether the massive investments in the technology will wind up paying off. That was evident in the drop by Google’s parent, Alphabet, which slipped after outlining an ambitious spending plan even as revenue beat estimates. Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, said the recent retreat is a reflection of the worries that the hottest stocks and the other assets, like gold, had simply run-up too far and were due for a little reckoning. “It’s a reset,” she said. “Momentum may have just strung itself out.” --With assistance from Matt Turner, Boris Korby and Michael Msika.

Parliamentarian Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu, whose party is aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s, plans to introduce a private member’s bill in the coming months barring children under 16 from maintaining social media accounts. The aim is to ensure data privacy and protect children and adolescents from exploitation, Devarayalu said in an interview.

State level officials and India’s finance ministry have also raised the issue of potential harms from social media. Any move to limit access to platforms in the world’s most populous nation would be a blow to the likes of Meta Platforms Inc.’s Instagram and Facebook, Snap Inc.’s Snapchat, Elon Musk’s X and more. Australia blocking under-16s from social media has prompted governments around the world to propose following suit, and a similar move by India would be the most significant yet by the number of users affected. Instagram and Facebook each have over 400 million users in India, more than any other country, according to DataReportal, a library of reports on global digital behavior. Snapchat has more than 200 million on its platform there, making India its largest market by users, while X has more than 20 million users, the data shows. While the companies typically earn less revenue per user in India than in more economically developed countries such as the US, India represents unrivaled potential for growth. It is home to the world’s largest remaining pool of untapped digital consumers, with legions of people yet to get online. Devarayalu said responsibility for ensuring compliance would rest with the tech firms. Penalties according to his planned Social Media Age Restrictions and Online Safety Bill could be as much as 2.5 billion rupees ($28 million) or 5% of a company’s global revenue, whichever is lower. “If we can ban apps like TikTok, or the ones for gambling, this can be done easily as well because the resources are there for it,” he said. Story Continues India in 2020 blocked TikTok and other Chinese apps on national security grounds and last year put in place a law banning online gambling. A Meta spokesperson said that the company wants young people to have safe experiences, that it thinks parents should decide which apps teens use, and that bans could push young people toward more dangerous parts of the internet. “We’ll comply with social media bans where they are enforced,” the spokesperson said. Snap and X, along with India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Devarayalu, 42, entered parliament in 2019 and is the vice chairman of a group of educational institutions in Andhra Pradesh. The southern state is studying Australia’s ban on children using social media, its minister in charge of technology and human resources said last month. Meanwhile, the IT minister for populous Maharashtra state, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, has ordered a task force be assembled to recommend methods for addressing the harms of social media to children. In a Monday post on X, he cited the “alarming rise in digital addiction among children and its adverse impact on their mental and physical well-being.” The minister, Ashish Shelar, said in an interview on Wednesday that a minimum age hadn’t been specified. Last week, India’s Economic Survey raised age-based restrictions on social media use as an issue for discussion. The annual survey is released by India’s Ministry of Finance and represents an annual report card on the economy and lays out the outlook for the country. Australia in December became the world’s first democracy to initiate such a social media crackdown with its under-16 ban. Several countries have since made similar moves or signaled they’re considering action. Spain’s prime minister on Tuesday said the country would limit social media use for those under 16, and at least six other countries, including France, the UK, and the Netherlands, are weighing similar restrictions.

2026-02-06 18:41:42,"1 Dividend Stock to Buy Now as Trump Tackles Housing Affordability Trump’s push to lower mortgage rates, cap card interest, and curb institutional home buying puts dividend‑payer Lennar at the center of the housing‑affordability trade, with the stock still trading at a modest discount.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-dividend-stock-buy-now-003002470.html,"In this article: LEN President Donald Trump is now openly pushing to make homeownership more attainable by calling for lower mortgage rates and directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a step he argues will help pull borrowing costs down from current levels near 6% on a 30‑year loan. He is also urging Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for a year, down from an average near 21%, to help households save faster for down payments. At the same time, he is seeking to ban large institutional investors from buying single‑family homes so ordinary buyers are not competing with deep‑pocketed landlords.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else. Amid this news, one established homebuilder has been thrust into the spotlight — Lennar Corporation (LEN). Lennar shares jumped roughly 8% in the past month, following many of these headlines. Still, the bigger question is whether this income‑paying name now offers a compelling way to gain exposure. Let’s dive in. LEN’s Income Backed by Real Numbers Lennar Corporation is a Miami‑based homebuilder designing and constructing affordable, move‑up, and active‑adult homes across the United States. Its equity base stands near $27.9 billion, and it returns cash through a forward annual dividend of $2 per share, which currently implies a yield of about 1.8%. At a share price of $115 as of this writing on Feb. 5, LEN is up about 11% year‑to‑date but down 10% over the last 52 weeks. www.barchart.com The forward price‑to‑earnings (P/E) multiple of 17.39x versus a sector median of 18.20x, alongside a price‑to‑book (P/B) ratio of 1.28x versus 2.67x, points to a modest discount. Lennar's latest financial results, released on Dec.16, 2025, showed total sales of roughly $9.4 billion, up 6.33% year-over-year, while net income fell to about $490.2 million, down 17.04%. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter of $2.03 versus a consensus estimate of $2.23, an 8.97% shortfall, which reflects tighter margins and incentives needed to keep homes moving. The report indicated operating cash flow of roughly $216.8 million for November 2025, more than doubling with 114.05% growth. While overall net cash flow was negative at about $1.16 billion, it still represented a 64.14% improvement from the prior year as LEN invested heavily in land, communities, and its pipeline. Story Continues Lennar Expands Affordable Housing Footprint Lennar is leaning directly into the affordability theme. The company recently began selling homes at River Bridge Ranch, a single‑family community in San Marcos, Texas, aimed at cost‑conscious buyers. Homes there range from 1,200 to 2,780 square feet, with three to five bedrooms and two to three bathrooms. Pricing starts in the mid‑$200,000 range. Each home comes with a standard features package included in the base price, which lines up with the kind of attainable product likely to benefit. Lennar has also been active on the capital‑allocation side. On Nov. 26, 2025, it reported final results of an exchange offer covering up to 33,298,764 shares of Millrose Properties Class A stock, about 20% of Millrose’s outstanding shares, in exchange for Lennar Class A common stock. The offer, which expired on Nov. 21, 2025, was oversubscribed, with 85,296,924 Lennar shares validly tendered and not withdrawn; 84,518,299 were subject to proration, and 778,625 were “odd‑lot” shares accepted in full. Lennar’s Outlook Through Wall Street’s Lens Lennar’s next big check‑in with the market lands on March 19, when it will report results for the quarter ending February 2026. Expectations here are deliberately conservative. The current quarter EPS estimate sits at $0.96 versus $2.14 earned in the same period a year earlier, pointing to an estimated year‑over‑year decline of about 55.14%. Looking a step ahead, for the quarter ending May 2026, the average EPS estimate is $1.41, down from $1.90 last year and implying a year‑over‑year drop of roughly 25.79%. On the rating side, the consensus stance from 19 analysts is a “Hold” — not an outright bullish call but far from a bearish one. The average price target stands at $107.15, compared with the current share price, which implies downside from here. www.barchart.com Conclusion Trump’s renewed focus on housing affordability makes Lennar look like a reasonable dividend name to own rather than avoid. The business is still growing, cash flow is improving, and the balance sheet moves plus affordable communities point in the right direction. Near term, the stock may cool or drift sideways after the recent jump on Trump home headlines. Over the next year or two, the risk-reward still appears tilted slightly higher as policy support and fundamentals gradually converge.

Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $751.2 million vs analyst estimates of $742.4 million (20.8% year-on-year growth, 1.2% beat) Adjusted EPS: $4.79 vs analyst estimates of $4.74 (1.1% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $269 million vs analyst estimates of $263.7 million (35.8% margin, 2% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $780 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $738 million Operating Margin: 26.6%, in line with the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 152, up from 139 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $54.46 billion “Our results demonstrate our continued success in transforming from a chip-only, semiconductor supplier to a full service, silicon-based solutions provider,” said Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS. Company Overview Founded in 1997 by its longtime CEO Michael Hsing, Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) is an analog and mixed signal chipmaker that specializes in power management chips meant to minimize total energy consumption. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Thankfully, Monolithic Power Systems’s 27% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth surpassed the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy). Monolithic Power Systems Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but short-term results matter for semiconductors because the rapid pace of technological innovation (Moore's Law) could make yesterday's hit product obsolete today. Monolithic Power Systems’s annualized revenue growth of 23.8% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Monolithic Power Systems Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Monolithic Power Systems reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 20.8%, and its $751.2 million of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 1.2%. Beyond the beat, this marks 8 straight quarters of growth, showing that the current upcycle has had a good run - a typical upcycle usually lasts 8-10 quarters. Company management is currently guiding for a 22.3% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Story continues Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 16.6% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Still, this projection is above average for the sector and implies the market is baking in some success for its newer products and services. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Monolithic Power Systems’s DIO came in at 152, which is 11 days below its five-year average. These numbers show that despite the recent increase, there’s no indication of an excessive inventory buildup. Monolithic Power Systems Inventory Days Outstanding Key Takeaways from Monolithic Power Systems’s Q4 Results It was great to see Monolithic Power Systems’s revenue guidance for next quarter top analysts’ expectations. We were also happy its adjusted operating income outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its inventory levels materially increased. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock traded up 1.5% to $1,175 immediately following the results. So do we think Monolithic Power Systems is an attractive buy at the current price? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

2026-02-06 18:41:50,Amazon Plans Its Own Big Boost In AI Spending. The Stock Is Tumbling. Amazon shares took a hit in extended trading Thursday after the cloud giant missed quarterly earnings estimates and followed peers with a big AI spending forecast.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-plans-own-big-boost-223816356.html,"In this article: AMZN Key Takeaways Amazon shares took a hit in extended trading Thursday after the cloud giant missed quarterly earnings estimates and followed peers with a big AI spending forecast. CEO Andy Jassy said that the company expects a ""strong long-term return"" on its investments. Amazon has big AI spending plans. That isn't helping its stock. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud giant tumbled over 7% in extended trading Thursday after the company missed quarterly earnings estimates and took Wall Street by surprise with a massive spending forecast that landed as investors are increasingly looking for evidence that big AI spending is paying off—and some of its big tech counterparts say they plan to keep shelling out. Amazon ( AMZN ) said its capital expenditures could reach $200 billion this year as it invests heavily in AI and robotics. That was well above the roughly $160 billion analysts expected. Why This Is Significant Several of Amazon's Big Tech peers, including cloud leaders Microsoft and Google , also saw shares take a hit recently after announcing larger-than-expected spending forecasts. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that the company expects a ""strong long-term return"" on its investments. He pointed to signals of strong demand at Amazon's cloud segment, which recorded its fastest growth in 13 quarters and which Jassy said on Thursdays' conference call would be the main recipient of the company's spending. Amazon Web Services revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $35.6 billion in the fourth quarter, above analysts' estimates. That helped propel Amazon's total revenue for the quarter to a record $213.4 billion. Earnings per share, however, came in just short of the analyst consensus at $1.95. Amazon said it expects first-quarter revenue of $173.5 billion and $178.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were expecting $175.38 billion. The company's report followed another from Google parent Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), which yesterday said it too planned to continue plowing money into AI technology . Amazon's stock, the weakest-performing Magnificent Seven member in 2025, was down about 4% for the year so far through Thursday's close. It finished today around $223, well off Wall Street's consensus price target near $300. Read the original article on Investopedia"

Company Overview With a network of 161 specialized facilities across 37 states and Puerto Rico, Encompass Health (NYSE:EHC) operates inpatient rehabilitation hospitals that help patients recover from strokes, hip fractures, and other debilitating conditions. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Over the last five years, Encompass Health grew its sales at a mediocre 5% compounded annual growth rate. This was below our standard for the healthcare sector and is a poor baseline for our analysis. Encompass Health Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Encompass Health’s annualized revenue growth of 11.2% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting some bright spots. Encompass Health Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can better understand the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its same-store sales, which show how much revenue its established locations generate. Over the last two years, Encompass Health’s same-store sales averaged 4.9% year-on-year growth. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth, we can see the opening of new locations is boosting the company’s top-line performance. Story Continues Encompass Health Same-Store Sales Growth This quarter, Encompass Health grew its revenue by 9.9% year on year, and its $1.54 billion of revenue was in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 8.6% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is commendable and suggests the market sees success for its products and services. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming. Click here to access a free report on our 3 favorite stocks to play this generational megatrend . Adjusted Operating Margin Encompass Health’s adjusted operating margin has risen over the last 12 months and averaged 17.2% over the last five years. Its solid profitability for a healthcare business shows it’s an efficient company that manages its expenses effectively. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Encompass Health’s adjusted operating margin of 17.2% for the trailing 12 months may be around the same as five years ago, but it has increased by 1.8 percentage points over the last two years. Encompass Health Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (Non-GAAP) This quarter, Encompass Health generated an adjusted operating margin profit margin of 16.1%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Encompass Health’s EPS grew at a spectacular 13.6% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 5% annualized revenue growth. However, we take this with a grain of salt because its adjusted operating margin didn’t improve and it didn’t repurchase its shares, meaning the delta came from reduced interest expenses or taxes. Encompass Health Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) In Q4, Encompass Health reported adjusted EPS of $1.46, up from $1.17 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Encompass Health’s full-year EPS of $5.46 to grow 6.1%. Key Takeaways from Encompass Health’s Q4 Results It was good to see Encompass Health beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter despite in line revenue. We were also happy its full-year EPS guidance outperformed Wall Street’s estimates, and this outlook is driving the stock up. Overall, this print had some key positives.

Revenue Growth Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. With $6.28 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, SS&C is one of the larger companies in the business services industry and benefits from a well-known brand that influences purchasing decisions. As you can see below, SS&C’s 6% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was decent. This shows its offerings generated slightly more demand than the average business services company, a useful starting point for our analysis. SS&C Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. SS&C’s annualized revenue growth of 6.8% over the last two years aligns with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was stable. Story continues SS&C Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, SS&C reported year-on-year revenue growth of 8%, and its $1.65 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 1.8%. Company management is currently guiding for a 7.5% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 5.4% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. Despite the slowdown, this projection is above the sector average and indicates the market sees some success for its newer products and services. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

Operating Margin Operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D. SS&C has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a business services business, boasting an average operating margin of 22.8%. Looking at the trend in its profitability, SS&C’s operating margin decreased by 1.7 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. SS&C Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, SS&C generated an operating margin profit margin of 22.3%, down 1.1 percentage points year on year. This reduction is quite minuscule and indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. SS&C’s unimpressive 7.4% annual EPS growth over the last five years aligns with its revenue performance. This tells us it maintained its per-share profitability as it expanded. SS&C Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For SS&C, its two-year annual EPS growth of 15.4% was higher than its five-year trend. This acceleration made it one of the faster-growing business services companies in recent history. In Q4, SS&C reported adjusted EPS of $1.69, up from $1.58 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 5%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects SS&C’s full-year EPS of $6.15 to grow 8%. Key Takeaways from SS&C’s Q4 Results Revenue and EPS both beat, which is a good start. We enjoyed seeing SS&C beat analysts’ full-year EPS guidance expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year revenue guidance exceeded Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The stock remained flat at $74.89 immediately after reporting. Should you buy the stock or not? We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

Viasat (VSAT) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $1.16 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.17 billion (3% year-on-year growth, 1% miss) Adjusted EPS: $0.79 vs analyst estimates of $0.24 (significant beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $387 million vs analyst estimates of $387.2 million (33.5% margin, in line) Operating Margin: 2.3%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was $444.2 million, up from -$33.17 million in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $5.37 billion Company Overview Operating a fleet of 23 satellites that orbit the Earth and beam connectivity from space, Viasat (NASDAQ:VSAT) provides satellite-based communications networks and services for airlines, maritime vessels, governments, businesses, and residential customers worldwide. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. With $4.62 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Viasat is one of the larger companies in the business services industry and benefits from a well-known brand that influences purchasing decisions. As you can see below, Viasat’s 15.4% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. This is an encouraging starting point for our analysis because it shows Viasat’s demand was higher than many business services companies. Viasat Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Viasat’s annualized revenue growth of 10.2% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Viasat Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Viasat’s revenue grew by 3% year on year to $1.16 billion, falling short of Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4.2% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health. The 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Story continues Operating Margin Operating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses – everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes. Although Viasat was profitable this quarter from an operational perspective, it’s generally struggled over a longer time period. Its expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 5.9% over the last five years. Unprofitable business services companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Viasat’s operating margin decreased by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Viasat’s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn’t pass them onto its customers. Viasat Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, Viasat generated an operating margin profit margin of 2.3%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Sadly for Viasat, its EPS declined by 2.6% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 15.4%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. Viasat Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) We can take a deeper look into Viasat’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Viasat’s operating margin was flat this quarter but declined by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 105%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders. Viasat Diluted Shares Outstanding Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business. For Viasat, its two-year annual EPS declines of 26.7% show it’s continued to underperform. These results were bad no matter how you slice the data. In Q4, Viasat reported adjusted EPS of $0.79, up from $0.11 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Viasat’s full-year EPS of $1.03 to shrink by 27.5%. Key Takeaways from Viasat’s Q4 Results It was good to see Viasat beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its revenue slightly missed. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The market seemed to be hoping for more, and the stock traded down 1.5% to $36.91 immediately after reporting. So should you invest in Viasat right now? The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy.

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.12 per share was 19% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Udemy? Find out in our full research report . Udemy (UDMY) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: On December 17, 2025, Udemy and Coursera entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Coursera will combine with Udemy in an all-stock transaction. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Udemy stockholders will receive 0.800 shares of Coursera common stock for each share of Udemy common stock. Upon the closing of the transaction, existing Coursera stockholders are expected to own approximately 59% and existing Udemy stockholders are expected to own approximately 41% of the combined company, on a fully diluted basis. Revenue: $194 million vs analyst estimates of $193.2 million (3% year-on-year decline, in line) Adjusted EPS: $0.12 vs analyst estimates of $0.10 (19% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $21.45 million vs analyst estimates of $19.67 million (11.1% margin, 9% beat) Free Cash Flow Margin: 6.1%, similar to the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $696.2 million “Udemy demonstrated strong execution in Q4 and throughout 2025, creating tangible momentum toward becoming the system of record for helping companies upskill their workforce in an increasingly AI-driven world,” said Udemy President & CEO Hugo Sarrazin. Company Overview With courses ranging from investing to cooking to computer programming, Udemy (NASDAQ:UDMY) is an online learning platform that connects learners with expert instructors who specialize in a wide range of topics. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Unfortunately, Udemy’s 7.9% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was tepid. This fell short of our benchmark for the consumer internet sector and is a poor baseline for our analysis. Udemy Quarterly Revenue This quarter, Udemy reported a rather uninspiring 3% year-on-year revenue decline to $194 million of revenue, in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years.

Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Story Continues Cash Is King Although EBITDA is undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can’t use accounting profits to pay the bills. Udemy has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company’s free cash flow margin averaged 6.9% over the last two years, slightly better than the broader consumer internet sector. Taking a step back, we can see that Udemy’s margin expanded by 21 percentage points over the last few years. This is encouraging, and we can see it became a less capital-intensive business because its free cash flow profitability rose more than its operating profitability. Udemy Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin Udemy’s free cash flow clocked in at $11.79 million in Q4, equivalent to a 6.1% margin. This result was good as its margin was 3 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, building on its favorable historical trend. Key Takeaways from Udemy’s Q4 Results We were impressed by how significantly Udemy blew past analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 2.5% to $4.83 immediately following the results.

2026-02-06 18:59:14,"The job market is off to a rocky start this year, new data shows",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/job-market-off-rocky-start-215946107.html,"A New York Department of Labor job fair at the Downtown Central Library in Buffalo, N.Y., in 2025. (Lauren Petracca / Bloomberg via Getty Images file) · Lauren Petracca New data on jobs and layoffs this week points to more job cuts and lackluster hiring plans, indicating 2026 might not be the fresh start many job seekers are looking for. A monthly survey of layoff announcements from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday found that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January, the highest cuts for the first month of the year since 2009. Last January, employers announced cuts just shy of 50,000 jobs, according to Challenger. In January 2009, more than 240,000 job cuts were announced. The firm also reported that employers announced the lowest total for hiring plans for the month of January since 2009, the year the firm started tracking the metric. Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for the firm, wrote that the high cut count signals “employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026.” However, JPMorgan noted that comparing the cuts to 2009 could be misleading. “While the report noted that 108k job cuts were the highest for January since 2009, this could be misleading on the severity,” JPMorgan said in a Thursday note. “This January was much more similar to recent January values than it was to 2009.” The bulk of announced cuts came from the transportation and technology sectors, followed by the health care sector, the firm reported, citing job cut announcements from UPS and Amazon. Last week, Amazon announced it would be cutting 16,000 jobs and UPS said it planned to slash up to 30,000 roles. The primary reasons for the January cuts reported by Challenger were cited as lost contracts, market and economic conditions, and restructuring. Only 7% of total January cuts were attributed to AI replacing workers, the firm said. Economist Mohamed A. El-Erian called the data “sobering” in a post on X . “Most notably, these layoffs are occurring while GDP continues to grow at approximately 4%, accelerating the decoupling of employment from economic growth — a phenomenon that, if it persists, has profound economic, political, and social implications,” he added. The release of the most closely watched jobs report for January, by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, was postponed due to the brief government shutdown. The January jobs report will now be released on Feb. 11. Another jobs report from ADP Research released Wednesday estimated that the private sector added just 22,000 jobs in January, driven primarily by an additional 74,000 roles in education and health services. ADP said the slowdown came from cuts in manufacturing, professional and business services and among large employers. Story Continues The Department of Labor on Thursday reported an increase of 22,000 initial claims for unemployment insurance for the week ending Jan. 31, over the previous week. Evercore ISI said in a Thursday note that the unemployment claims should “put some downside pressure on Treasury yields and the dollar.” It estimated that payroll employment increased by around 75,000 jobs last month. However, BLS did release data on job openings and labor turnover for December on Thursday. The bureau reported that nonfarm job openings “continued to trend down” for the month, with a decrease of 386,000 openings. The largest dips came from professional and business services, followed by retail trade and finance and insurance. BLS said openings were down by nearly a million roles over the year. “The job market has continued to reflect a low-hire, low-fire dynamic,” Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said in an emailed statement. “The key question now is whether we’re slipping into a weaker environment.” As BLS prepares to release its official employment report for last month, more layoffs have already begun. On Wednesday, The Washington Post cut a third of its staff. This article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

Additionally, we materially improved the risk profile of the Closed Block, and returned significant capital to our shareholders,” said Richard P. McKenney, president and chief executive officer. Company Overview Tracing its roots back to 1848 when financial security for workers was virtually non-existent, Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) provides workplace financial protection benefits including disability, life, accident, critical illness, dental and vision insurance primarily through employers. Revenue Growth Insurance companies earn revenue from three primary sources: 1) The core insurance business itself, often called underwriting and represented in the income statement as premiums 2) Income from investing the “float” (premiums collected upfront not yet paid out as claims) in assets such as fixed-income assets and equities 3) Fees from various sources such as policy administration, annuities, or other value-added services. Regrettably, Unum Group’s revenue grew at a sluggish 1.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmarks and is a poor baseline for our analysis. Unum Group Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within financials, a half-decade historical view may miss recent interest rate changes and market returns. Unum Group’s annualized revenue growth of 3% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, but we were still disappointed by the results. Unum Group Year-On-Year Revenue Growth Note: Quarters not shown were determined to be outliers, impacted by outsized investment gains/losses that are not indicative of the recurring fundamentals of the business. This quarter, Unum Group missed Wall Street’s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 0.1% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $3.24 billion of revenue. Story Continues Net premiums earned made up 80.8% of the company’s total revenue during the last five years, meaning Unum Group barely relies on non-insurance activities to drive its overall growth. Unum Group Quarterly Net Premiums Earned as % of Revenue While insurers generate revenue from multiple sources, investors view net premiums earned as the cornerstone - its direct link to core operations stands in sharp contrast to the unpredictability of investment returns and fees. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming. Click here to access a free report on our 3 favorite stocks to play this generational megatrend . Book Value Per Share (BVPS) Insurers are balance sheet businesses, collecting premiums upfront and paying out claims over time. Premiums collected but not yet paid out, often referred to as the float, are invested and create an asset base supported by a liability structure. Book value per share (BVPS) captures this dynamic by measuring these assets (investment portfolio, cash, reinsurance recoverables) less liabilities (claim reserves, debt, future policy benefits). BVPS is essentially the residual value for shareholders. We therefore consider BVPS very important to track for insurers and a metric that sheds light on business quality because it reflects long-term capital growth and is harder to manipulate than more commonly-used metrics like EPS. Unum Group’s BVPS grew at a tepid 4.7% annual clip over the last five years. However, BVPS growth has accelerated recently, growing by 16% annually over the last two years from $49.91 to $67.11 per share. Unum Group Quarterly Book Value per Share Over the next 12 months, Consensus estimates call for Unum Group’s BVPS to grow by 24.4% to $78.65, elite growth rate. Key Takeaways from Unum Group’s Q4 Results We struggled to find many positives in these results. Its EPS missed and its book value per share fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 7.5% to $70.04 immediately after reporting. Unum Group underperformed this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now?

Additionally, as highlighted last quarter, we continue to invest in AI and broader automation efforts internally to drive greater efficiency and productivity across our business, as evidenced by our increasing free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margins. I would also like to thank all of our Paylocity teams as they support our clients through our busiest time of year,” said Toby Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paylocity. Company Overview Operating in a field where companies traditionally juggled multiple disconnected systems, Paylocity (NASDAQ:PCTY) provides cloud-based human capital management and payroll software solutions that help businesses manage their workforce and HR processes. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Paylocity grew its sales at a solid 23.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Story Continues Paylocity Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within software, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Paylocity’s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 14% over the last two years was below its five-year trend. Paylocity Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Paylocity reported year-on-year revenue growth of 10.4%, and its $416.1 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 1.9%. Company management is currently guiding for a 7.7% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 6.4% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. The 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Annual Recurring Revenue While reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable. Paylocity’s ARR came in at $387 million in Q4, and over the last four quarters, its growth was underwhelming as it averaged 13% year-on-year increases. This performance mirrored its total sales and suggests that increasing competition is causing challenges in securing longer-term commitments. Paylocity Annual Recurring Revenue Customer Acquisition Efficiency The customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it’s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability. Paylocity is very efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 27.6 months this quarter. The company’s rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs means it can attempt to spur growth by increasing its sales and marketing investments. Paylocity CAC Payback Period Key Takeaways from Paylocity’s Q4 Results We enjoyed seeing Paylocity beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year EBITDA guidance slightly exceeded Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this print had some key positives. The market seemed to be hoping for more, and the stock traded down 1.4% to $125.51 immediately after reporting. So do we think Paylocity is an attractive buy at the current price? The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy.

Coty (COTY) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $1.68 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.66 billion (flat year on year, 1.1% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.14 vs analyst expectations of $0.18 (24.2% miss) Adjusted EBITDA: $330.2 million vs analyst estimates of $338.1 million (19.7% margin, 2.3% miss) Operating Margin: 8.8%, down from 16.1% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 30.6%, up from 25.1% in the same quarter last year Organic Revenue fell 3% year on year (beat) Market Capitalization: $3 billion Company Overview With a portfolio boasting many household brands, Coty (NYSE:COTY) is a beauty products powerhouse spanning cosmetics, fragrances, and skincare. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. With $5.81 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Coty carries some recognizable products but is a mid-sized consumer staples company. Its size could bring disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from better brand awareness and economies of scale. As you can see below, Coty’s sales grew at a sluggish 3.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years. This shows it failed to generate demand in any major way and is a rough starting point for our analysis. Coty Quarterly Revenue This quarter, Coty’s $1.68 billion of revenue was flat year on year but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 1.1%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection doesn't excite us and implies its newer products will not accelerate its top-line performance yet.

This metric captures a business’s performance excluding one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures as well as foreign currency fluctuations.

Story Continues Coty Year-On-Year Organic Revenue Growth In the latest quarter, Coty’s organic sales fell by 3% year on year. This decrease represents a further deceleration from its historical levels. We hope the business can get back on track. Key Takeaways from Coty’s Q4 Results It was good to see Coty narrowly top analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also happy its organic revenue was in line with Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its EPS missed and its EBITDA fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 14% to $2.71 immediately after reporting. Coty’s earnings report left more to be desired. Let’s look forward to see if this quarter has created an opportunity to buy the stock. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

2026-02-06 18:59:25,Amazon stock falls after earnings on $200 billion capex plan,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-stock-falls-earnings-200-214541347.html,"In this article: AMZN Amazon’s fourth-quarter earnings had two distinct personalities. The first was the one investors have been paying for lately : a cleaner, sharper Amazon that’s figured out how to make its scale throw off real profit. The second was the one Amazon can’t stop becoming when the next platform shift shows up on the horizon: a company willing to pour concrete, string fiber, and buy chips like it’s trying to build the future faster than anyone can invoice it. Both versions showed up in the same document. The quarter itself was strong. And then CEO Andy Jassy volunteered the sentence that made everything else feel like preamble: “With such strong demand for our existing offerings and seminal opportunities like AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites, we expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026, and anticipate strong long-term return on invested capital.” The market’s response wasn’t “Nice quarter.” It was “Excuse me, you’re spending HOW much?” In a week when investors have started treating AI spending plans the way Americans treat rising restaurant menu prices — with widening eyes and a sudden interest in doing the math — Amazon effectively walked up to order the tasting menu for the whole table. Shares fell as much as 10% in after-hours trading. Big Tech’s capex plans have become the market’s favorite form of indigestion, and a bad tape doesn’t exactly make investors more patient about long-dated payoffs. AWS does the heavy lifting The underlying print was, by most conventional measures, strong. Amazon beat the revenue number analysts were carrying into the report (about $211.4 billion), and AWS came in above expectations. Earnings per share landed at $1.95, a hair below the $1.97 many previews were modeling — the kind of miss that normally gets filed under “within the noise.” Amazon’s framing leaned on momentum: AWS delivered “our fastest growth in 13 quarters,” advertising grew 23%, and custom chips were up triple digits, the company said. But this earnings season has been running on a different fuel. The market is no longer grading these companies on whether they can post big numbers. The market is grading these companies on whether they can explain why the big numbers are worth the even bigger checks. The largest Big Tech players are expected to spend more than $500 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, and investors have started picking favorites based on who pairs spending with clean growth and who pairs it with softer near-term outlooks . Amazon put itself squarely in the second bucket, not because the quarter was weak, but because its guidance invited a heavy dose of skepticism. Story continues The company’s first-quarter operating income forecast — $16.5 billion to $21.5 billion — came in below the $22.04 billion analysts were expecting; operating income is the bridge between “trust us, we’re investing” and “here’s the profit you can actually underwrite.” The same release that celebrated acceleration also warned that Q1 would absorb higher costs, including about $1 billion of incremental “Amazon Leo” expenses year over year, plus investment in faster commerce and sharper pricing in international stores. The capex number, though, is what turned a fairly straightforward earnings story into a referendum. Amazon’s $200 billion figure forces investors to rewrite their free-cash-flow assumptions in real time. The bill comes due The company already told everyone this movie’s first act: trailing-12-month operating cash flow rose 20% to $139.5 billion, but trailing-12-month free cash flow fell to $11.2 billion, driven “primarily” by a $50.7 billion year-over-year increase in property-and-equipment purchases tied to AI investment. Capex isn’t a theoretical risk here . It’s already compressing the numbers investors underwrite. Amazon’s capex has already been running at an eye-watering pace: close to $38 billion in the fourth quarter alone, which makes the 2026 figure feel like quite an acceleration. Heading into the print, capex expectations were clustered well below $200 billion — sometimes closer to $150 billion. A $200 billion plan doesn’t just imply more data centers and more chips. It implies more depreciation, more execution risk, and a longer runway before the cash returns feel obvious. It also raises the question that now hangs over every hyperscaler call: Is this spending being pulled by customer demand or being pushed by competitive fear? The near-term outlook didn’t help. Amazon guided first-quarter operating income to $16.5 billion to $21.5 billion, tied to roughly $1 billion of higher year-over-year costs tied to scaling its low-Earth-orbit satellite effort, plus more investment in quick commerce and sharper pricing internationally. Sales outside North America jumped 17% in the quarter, but operating income slipped to $1 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier. Amazon is still buying growth abroad, even as it asks investors to fun a historic infrastructure build. Amazon made the demand case as hard as it could in its press release. It highlighted an expanding stable of AI offerings and customer wins; it pointed to momentum in its custom silicon, saying Trainium and Graviton have a combined annual revenue run rate above $10 billion; and it described large-scale infrastructure projects meant to ease capacity constraints. That’s all well and great. But investors aren’t disputing that Amazon can spend. They’re disputing the timeline for when spending turns into a cleaner profit and cash narrative — and, for now, some investors aren't willing to take that on faith. There’s a reason AWS remains the emotional center of this story: It generates about 60% of Amazon’s operating profit. When AWS is accelerating, the market is inclined to believe the capex will be absorbed and monetized. When the forward profit guide looks light, the market starts wondering whether the bill is arriving faster than the payoff. Meanwhile, Amazon’s rivals are posting faster percentages — so Amazon can be telling a demand story and still have to act like its playing defense. Amazon wants to be the company that invests like a national utility and earns like a software platform, all while trimming and reorganizing elsewhere to prove it’s still serious about efficiency and margins. In late January, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts as part of a broader restructuring push . So: cut costs in the org chart, spend aggressively in the data center, and ask investors to focus on long-term returns. Amazon is telling investors that it’s choosing to spend — on infrastructure, on speed, on pricing, on a satellite business it’s explicitly flagging as a scaling cost — at the exact moment investors are re-litigating what “responsible” looks like in the AI era. The quarter gave Amazon plenty of ammunition — better-than-expected revenue, stronger AWS growth, solid operating income, and a set of businesses that still know how to scale. The guidance and capex number demand a second, more difficult thing: a credible explanation of pacing and payoff. Now, Amazon has one job: to make the $200 billion feel like an answer to demand instead of a reflex to competition. Investors can tolerate a build year. They just want to know whether they’re funding a backlog or funding an AI arms race."

On the other hand, next quarter’s revenue guidance of $72.5 million was less impressive, coming in 19.9% below analysts’ estimates. Its GAAP loss of $0.04 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Impinj? Find out in our full research report . Impinj (PI) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $92.85 million vs analyst estimates of $92.44 million (1.4% year-on-year growth, in line) EPS (GAAP): -$0.04 vs analyst estimates of -$0.04 (in line) Adjusted EBITDA: $16.43 million vs analyst estimates of $18.14 million (17.7% margin, 9.4% miss) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $72.5 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $90.56 million EBITDA guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $1.95 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $12.78 million Operating Margin: -2.9%, up from -3.9% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 14.7%, up from 9.3% in the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 173, down from 177 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $4.58 billion Company Overview Founded by Caltech professor Carver Mead and one of his students Chris Diorio, Impinj (NASDAQ:PI) is a maker of radio-frequency identification (RFID) hardware and software. Revenue Growth Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, Impinj’s 21% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was exceptional. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions. Impinj Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but short-term results matter for semiconductors because the rapid pace of technological innovation (Moore's Law) could make yesterday's hit product obsolete today. Impinj’s annualized revenue growth of 8.4% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Impinj Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Impinj grew its revenue by 1.4% year on year, and its $92.85 million of revenue was in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Company management is currently guiding for a 2.4% year-on-year decline in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 22.5% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is healthy and suggests its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance.

We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Impinj’s DIO came in at 173, which is 8 days above its five-year average. These numbers suggest that despite the recent decrease, the company’s inventory levels are higher than what we’ve seen in the past. Impinj Inventory Days Outstanding Key Takeaways from Impinj’s Q4 Results It was good to see Impinj improve its inventory levels, even if just slightly. On the other hand, its EBITDA missed and revenue guidance for next quarter missed. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 18.4% to $126.09 immediately following the results.

Revenue Growth Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last five years, Molina Healthcare grew its sales at an impressive 18.7% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. Molina Healthcare Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Molina Healthcare’s annualized revenue growth of 15.5% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Molina Healthcare Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can dig further into the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of customers, which reached 5.49 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Molina Healthcare’s customer base averaged 50,884,975% year-on-year growth. Because this number is better than its revenue growth, we can see the average customer spent less money each year on the company’s products and services. Story Continues Molina Healthcare Customers This quarter, Molina Healthcare reported year-on-year revenue growth of 8.3%, and its $11.38 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 3.7%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 2.7% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.

Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Operating Margin Operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D. Molina Healthcare was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 3.5% was weak for a healthcare business. Looking at the trend in its profitability, Molina Healthcare’s operating margin decreased by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. This performance was caused by more recent speed bumps as the company’s margin fell by 2.9 percentage points on a two-year basis. We still like Molina Healthcare but would like to see it make some adjustments. Molina Healthcare Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, Molina Healthcare generated an operating margin profit margin of negative 1.4%, down 5 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Sadly for Molina Healthcare, its EPS declined by 5.9% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 18.7%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded due to non-fundamental factors such as interest expenses and taxes. Molina Healthcare Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) We can take a deeper look into Molina Healthcare’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Molina Healthcare’s operating margin declined by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals. In Q4, Molina Healthcare reported adjusted EPS of negative $2.75, down from $5.05 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts’ estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Molina Healthcare’s full-year EPS of $10.65 to grow 26.5%. Key Takeaways from Molina Healthcare’s Q4 Results We enjoyed seeing Molina Healthcare beat analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its full-year revenue guidance missed and its full-year EPS guidance fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 33.4% to $117.85 immediately after reporting. Molina Healthcare underperformed this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now?

Bloom Energy (BE) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $777.7 million vs analyst estimates of $655.1 million (35.9% year-on-year growth, 18.7% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.45 vs analyst estimates of $0.30 (50.4% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $146.1 million vs analyst estimates of $107 million (18.8% margin, 36.6% beat) Operating Margin: 17.1%, down from 18.3% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 50.8%, down from 82.7% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $34.85 billion KR Sridhar, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Bloom Energy said, “Bring-your-own-power has shifted from a slogan to a business necessity for AI hyperscalers and manufacturing facilities. This shift is secular and growing. We have built a solid state digital power platform for the digital age that is superior to any legacy solution.” Company Overview Working in stealth mode for eight years, Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) designs, manufactures, and markets solid oxide fuel cell systems for on-site power generation. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Thankfully, Bloom Energy’s 20.6% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth surpassed the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. Bloom Energy Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. Bloom Energy’s annualized revenue growth of 23.2% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated. Bloom Energy Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can better understand the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its most important segments, Product and Service, which are 82.1% and 7.9% of revenue. Over the last two years, Bloom Energy’s Product revenue (energy servers and electrolyzers) averaged 26.3% year-on-year growth while its Service revenue (operations and maintenance agreements) averaged 12.6% growth. Story Continues Bloom Energy Quarterly Revenue by Segment This quarter, Bloom Energy reported wonderful year-on-year revenue growth of 35.9%, and its $777.7 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 18.7%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 23.7% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection is eye-popping and indicates the market is baking in success for its products and services. The 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Operating Margin Although Bloom Energy was profitable this quarter from an operational perspective, it’s generally struggled over a longer time period. Its expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 6.3% over the last five years. Unprofitable industrials companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. On the plus side, Bloom Energy’s operating margin rose by 17.6 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. Still, it will take much more for the company to show consistent profitability. Bloom Energy Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, Bloom Energy generated an operating margin profit margin of 17.1%, down 1.2 percentage points year on year. Since Bloom Energy’s gross margin decreased more than its operating margin, we can assume its recent inefficiencies were driven more by weaker leverage on its cost of sales rather than increased marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead expenses. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Bloom Energy’s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last five years. This is a good sign and shows it’s at an inflection point. Bloom Energy Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For Bloom Energy, its two-year annual EPS growth of 151% was higher than its five-year trend. We love it when earnings growth accelerates, especially when it accelerates off an already high base. In Q4, Bloom Energy reported adjusted EPS of $0.45, up from $0.43 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Bloom Energy’s full-year EPS of $0.73 to grow 47.1%. Key Takeaways from Bloom Energy’s Q4 Results It was good to see Bloom Energy beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its EBITDA outperformed Wall Street’s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its Service revenue missed. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 9.1% to $151 immediately following the results. Bloom Energy had an encouraging quarter, but one earnings result doesn’t necessarily make the stock a buy. Let’s see if this is a good investment. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

2026-02-06 10:01:01,Estée Lauder Stock Tumbled 20% Today. Here's What Dragged the Shares Lower,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-stock-tumbled-214113017.html,"In this article: EL Key Takeaways Estée Lauder's latest results beat expectations, and the company raised its outlook. Investors, however, didn't like what they saw. After rising more than 45% in the past year, the shares dropped today, finishing 19% lower. Estée Lauder's latest forecast wasn't a winning look. The cosmetics company reported second-quarter results Thursday that sent investors running—and the stock to its lowest close since December—despite results that beat expectations and an improved outlook for the year. The company's reiteration of a $100 million expected second-half tariff hit to profits, along with the stock's steady climb off April lows that may have led to high expectations, likely weighed on the shares. Why This News Matters to Consumers Economists have long said consumers will shoulder most of the cost of tariffs. There has been debate about how long this process may take, as some companies, such as Estée Lauder, acknowledge they have not yet offset the expense. Estée Lauder Cos. ( EL ), parent company of Bobbi Brown and Clinique, hoped to cast its results as long-awaited progress. Sales picked up in Europe, China and other Asian markets. And after 10 years of losing market share, Estée Lauder is gaining ground in the Americas by expanding beyond department stores and selling via Amazon ( AMZN ), Tik Tok and Sephora, CEO Stéphane de la Faverie said on a conference call Thursday. ""One of the main challenges that we see is: the enacted tariffs are starting to hurt consumer confidence in Latin America,"" de la Faverie said, according to a transcript provided by Alpha Sense. ""But overall, I want to say, I feel very strong."" The company reported $4.2 trillion in sales for the quarter ended Dec. 31—a 6% increase from last year, and slightly above the consensus analyst estimate from Visible Alpha. That translated to about $0.89 in adjusted earnings per share, compared to the $0.82 analysts anticipated, per Visible Alpha. Estée Lauder also raised its earnings outlook for the full fiscal year. The company expects to end 2026 with an adjusted operating profit margin of 9.8% to 10.2%, despite a dip in the third quarter due to tariffs and other headwinds. That's up from the 9.4% to 9.9% margin given in prior guidance. Today's investor reaction, however, was deeply negative, with the shares finishing 19% lower even after a bounce from intraday lows. The stock finished Wednesday's session above Wall Street's consensus price target, per Visible Alpha Data; it's now some 15% below it. Read the original article on Investopedia 查看留言"

Guidance for next quarter’s revenue was optimistic at $1.26 billion at the midpoint, 2.4% above analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.44 per share was 2.7% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Microchip Technology? Find out in our full research report . Microchip Technology (MCHP) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $1.19 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.18 billion (15.6% year-on-year growth, 0.6% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.44 vs analyst estimates of $0.43 (2.7% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $337.8 million vs analyst estimates of $324.7 million (28.5% margin, 4% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $1.26 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $1.23 billion Adjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $0.50 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $0.49 Operating Margin: 12.8%, up from 3% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 26.9%, up from 24.7% in the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 201, up from 198 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $42.28 billion Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s CEO and President commented that, “Our fiscal third quarter results exceeded our expectations, with net sales of $1.186 billion growing 4% sequentially, and 15.6% year-over-year, well above our original guidance. We believe the broad-based recovery across our end markets, combined with significant margin expansion, demonstrates the tangible impact of our nine-point recovery plan execution. Our non-GAAP operating profit grew sequentially more than our net sales did in the December quarter, highlighting the operational momentum we have in our business.” Company Overview Spun out from General Instrument in 1987, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: MCHP) is a leading provider of microcontrollers and integrated circuits used mainly in the automotive world, especially in electric vehicles and their charging devices. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Microchip Technology’s demand was weak and its revenue declined by 3.8% per year. This wasn’t a great result and suggests it’s a low quality business. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions. Story continues Microchip Technology Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Microchip Technology’s recent performance shows its demand remained suppressed as its revenue has declined by 28.5% annually over the last two years. Microchip Technology Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Microchip Technology reported year-on-year revenue growth of 15.6%, and its $1.19 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 0.6%. Adding to the positive news, Microchip Technology’s growth inflected positively this quarter, news that will likely give some shareholders hope. Company management is currently guiding for a 29.8% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 21.9% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is noteworthy and indicates its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Microchip Technology’s DIO came in at 201, which is 25 days above its five-year average, suggesting that the company’s inventory has grown to higher levels than we’ve seen in the past. Microchip Technology Inventory Days Outstanding Key Takeaways from Microchip Technology’s Q4 Results We enjoyed seeing Microchip Technology beat analysts’ adjusted operating income expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this print had some key positives. Investors were likely hoping for more, and shares traded down 4% to $75.03 immediately after reporting. Should you buy the stock or not?

StepStone Group (STEP) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Assets Under Management: $220 billion vs analyst estimates of $840.5 billion (22.9% year-on-year growth, 73.8% miss) Revenue: $586.5 million vs analyst estimates of $418.3 million (140% year-on-year growth, 40.2% beat) Pre-tax Profit: -$194.6 million (-33.2% margin) Adjusted EPS: $0.65 vs analyst estimates of $0.62 (4.7% beat) Market Capitalization: $5.06 billion Company Overview Operating as both an advisor and asset manager with over $100 billion in assets under management, StepStone Group (NASDAQ:STEP) is an investment firm that provides clients with access to private market investments across private equity, real estate, private debt, and infrastructure. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Thankfully, StepStone Group’s 34% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth surpassed the average financials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. StepStone Group Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within financials, a half-decade historical view may miss recent interest rate changes, market returns, and industry trends. StepStone Group’s annualized revenue growth of 47.9% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated. StepStone Group Year-On-Year Revenue Growth Note: Quarters not shown were determined to be outliers, impacted by outsized investment gains/losses that are not indicative of the recurring fundamentals of the business. This quarter, StepStone Group reported magnificent year-on-year revenue growth of 140%, and its $586.5 million of revenue beat Wall Street’s estimates by 40.2%. Microsoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend. We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Assets Under Management (AUM) Assets Under Management (AUM) represents the total value of investments that a financial institution manages for its clients. These assets generate steady income through management fees, creating predictable revenue streams that remain stable so long as clients remain invested with the firm. Story Continues StepStone Group’s AUM has grown at an annual rate of 23.4% over the last five years, much better than the broader financials industry but slower than its total revenue. When analyzing StepStone Group’s AUM over the last two years, we can see that growth decelerated to 21.3% annually. Fundraising or short-term investment performance were net detractors to the company over this shorter period since assets grew slower than total revenue. That said, assets aren't the be-all and end-all due to their unpredictable and cyclical nature. StepStone Group Assets Under Management StepStone Group’s AUM punched in at $220 billion this quarter, falling 73.8% short of analysts’ expectations. This print was 22.9% higher than the same quarter last year. Key Takeaways from StepStone Group’s Q4 Results We were impressed by how significantly StepStone Group blew past analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its AUM missed. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock remained flat at $59.04 immediately after reporting. Big picture, is StepStone Group a buy here and now? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

Its GAAP profit of $0.49 per share was 3.7% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Exponent? Find out in our full research report . Exponent (EXPO) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $147.4 million vs analyst estimates of $128.1 million (19.1% year-on-year growth, 15.1% beat) EPS (GAAP): $0.49 vs analyst estimates of $0.47 (3.7% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $34.71 million vs analyst estimates of $36.08 million (23.5% margin, 3.8% miss) Operating Margin: 19.8%, down from 22% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $3.50 billion “We delivered a strong finish to 2025 reflecting the strength, diversification, and resilience of our portfolio,” stated Dr. Catherine Corrigan, President and Chief Executive Officer. Company Overview With a team of over 800 consultants holding advanced degrees in 90+ technical disciplines, Exponent (NASDAQ:EXPO) is a science and engineering consulting firm that investigates complex problems and provides expert analysis for clients across various industries. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. With $554.8 million in revenue over the past 12 months, Exponent is a small player in the business services space, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and numerous distribution channels. On the bright side, it can grow faster because it has more room to expand. As you can see below, Exponent grew its sales at a solid 8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This shows it had high demand, a useful starting point for our analysis. Exponent Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Exponent’s annualized revenue growth of 5.6% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were respectable. Exponent Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Exponent reported year-on-year revenue growth of 19.1%, and its $147.4 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 15.1%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4.1% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and suggests its products and services will see some demand headwinds. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Story Continues Operating Margin Exponent has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a business services business, boasting an average operating margin of 24.3%. Looking at the trend in its profitability, Exponent’s operating margin decreased by 3.5 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Exponent Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, Exponent generated an operating margin profit margin of 19.8%, down 2.3 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Exponent’s unimpressive 6% annual EPS growth over the last five years aligns with its revenue performance. On the bright side, this tells us its incremental sales were profitable. Exponent Trailing 12-Month EPS (GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business. For Exponent, its two-year annual EPS growth of 3.2% was lower than its five-year trend. We hope its growth can accelerate in the future. In Q4, Exponent reported EPS of $0.49, up from $0.46 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 3.7%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Exponent’s full-year EPS of $2.07 to grow 7.8%. Key Takeaways from Exponent’s Q4 Results We were impressed by how significantly Exponent blew past analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock remained flat at $70.83 immediately after reporting. So should you invest in Exponent right now? What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.

Revenue Growth A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Luckily, Doximity’s sales grew at an impressive 29.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth surpassed the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. Doximity Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within software, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Doximity’s annualized revenue growth of 16.7% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were respectable.

Company management is currently guiding for a 3.8% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years.

We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Customer Acquisition Efficiency The customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period measures the months a company needs to recoup the money spent on acquiring a new customer. This metric helps assess how quickly a business can break even on its sales and marketing investments. Doximity is extremely efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 6.4 months this quarter. The company’s rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs indicates it has a highly differentiated product offering and a strong brand reputation. These dynamics give Doximity more resources to pursue new product initiatives while maintaining the flexibility to increase its sales and marketing investments. Key Takeaways from Doximity’s Q4 Results We enjoyed seeing Doximity beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed and its EBITDA guidance for next quarter fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 32.5% to $22.50 immediately after reporting. The latest quarter from Doximity’s wasn’t that good. One earnings report doesn’t define a company’s quality, though, so let’s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price.

The company expects next quarter’s revenue to be around $106.5 million, close to analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.23 per share was 19.5% above analysts’ consensus estimates.

Power Integrations (POWI) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $103.2 million vs analyst estimates of $103 million (1.9% year-on-year decline, in line) Adjusted EPS: $0.23 vs analyst estimates of $0.19 (19.5% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $10.02 million vs analyst estimates of $8.13 million (9.7% margin, 23.2% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $106.5 million at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting Operating Margin: 8.5%, up from 3.7% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 18.6%, up from 11.1% in the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 313, up from 277 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $2.61 billion Power Integrations CEO Jen Lloyd commented: “I am pleased that we returned to growth in 2025 with a six-percent increase in total revenue, led by our industrial category which grew 15 percent. The growth in industrial was driven by record sales in our high-power gate-driver business, plus strength in metering, power tools, automotive and broad-based industrial applications. Additionally, total revenue from PowiGaN™ products grew more than 40 percent for the year.” Company Overview A leading supplier of parts for electronics such as home appliances, Power Integrations (NASDAQ:POWI) is a semiconductor designer and developer specializing in products used for high-voltage power conversion. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Power Integrations’s demand was weak over the last five years as its sales fell at a 1.9% annual rate. This wasn’t a great result and suggests it’s a low quality business. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions. Power Integrations Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Power Integrations’s revenue over the last two years was flat, sugggesting its demand was weak but stabilized after its initial drop. Story Continues Power Integrations Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Power Integrations reported a rather uninspiring 1.9% year-on-year revenue decline to $103.2 million of revenue, in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Company management is currently guiding for flat sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 7.6% over the next 12 months. Although this projection indicates its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.

Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Power Integrations’s DIO came in at 313, which is 86 days above its five-year average, suggesting that the company’s inventory has grown to higher levels than we’ve seen in the past. Power Integrations Inventory Days Outstanding Key Takeaways from Power Integrations’s Q4 Results It was good to see Power Integrations beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its adjusted operating income outperformed Wall Street’s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its inventory levels materially increased. Overall, we think this was still a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. Investors were likely hoping for more, and shares traded down 3.3% to $45.84 immediately after reporting.

Its GAAP profit of $0.34 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy News Corp? Find out in our full research report . News Corp (NWSA) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $2.36 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.29 billion (5.5% year-on-year growth, 3% beat) EPS (GAAP): $0.34 vs analyst estimates of $0.34 (in line) Adjusted EBITDA: $517 million vs analyst estimates of $498.9 million (21.9% margin, 3.6% beat) Operating Margin: 10.2%, down from 16.3% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 5.6%, down from 6.8% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $14.33 billion Company Overview Established in 2013 after a restructuring, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) is a multinational conglomerate known for its news publishing, broadcasting, digital media, and book publishing. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Unfortunately, News Corp struggled to consistently increase demand as its $8.62 billion of sales for the trailing 12 months was close to its revenue five years ago. This was below our standards and is a sign of poor business quality. News Corp Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or trend. Just like its five-year trend, News Corp’s revenue over the last two years was flat, suggesting it is in a slump. News Corp Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can better understand the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its three most important segments: Dow Jones, News Media, and Book Publishing, which are 27%, 25.8%, and 23.6% of revenue. Over the last two years, News Corp’s Dow Jones (media subsidiary) and News Media (general media) revenues averaged year-on-year growth of 6.2% and 1.6% while its Book Publishing revenue (general publishing) averaged 2.1% declines. News Corp Quarterly Revenue by Segment This quarter, News Corp reported year-on-year revenue growth of 5.5%, and its $2.36 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 3%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3% over the next 12 months. Although this projection implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it.

Story Continues Operating Margin Operating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses – everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes. News Corp’s operating margin has been trending down over the last 12 months and averaged 10.3% over the last two years. The company’s profitability was mediocre for a consumer discretionary business and shows it couldn’t pass its higher operating expenses onto its customers. News Corp Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, News Corp generated an operating margin profit margin of 10.2%, down 6.1 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. News Corp’s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last five years. This is encouraging and shows it’s at a critical moment in its life. News Corp Trailing 12-Month EPS (GAAP) In Q4, News Corp reported EPS of $0.34, down from $0.38 in the same quarter last year. This print slightly missed analysts’ estimates. We also like to analyze expected EPS growth based on Wall Street analysts’ consensus projections, but there is insufficient data. Key Takeaways from News Corp’s Q4 Results It was encouraging to see News Corp beat analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also happy its EBITDA outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its EPS was in line. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock traded up 1.3% to $24.94 immediately following the results. Big picture, is News Corp a buy here and now? We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

2026-02-06 10:01:18,Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q4 CY2025: Beats On Revenue But Stock Drops,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-nasdaq-amzn-q4-cy2025-212600289.html,"In this article: AMZN GOOG MSFT AAPL Cloud computing and online retail behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q4 CY2025, with sales up 13.6% year on year to $213.4 billion. The company expects next quarter’s revenue to be around $176 billion, close to analysts’ estimates. Its GAAP profit of $1.95 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Amazon? Find out in our full research report . Amazon (AMZN) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $213.4 billion vs analyst estimates of $211.6 billion (0.9% beat) Operating Profit (GAAP): $24.98 billion vs analyst estimates of $25.08 billion (small miss) EPS (GAAP): $1.95 vs analyst expectations of $1.96 (in line) North America Revenue: $127.1 billion vs analyst estimates of $127 billion (small beat) AWS Revenue: $35.58 billion vs analyst estimates of $34.85 billion (2.1% beat) North America Operating Profit: $11.47 billion vs analyst estimates of $10.83 billion (6% beat) AWS Operating Profit: $12.47 billion vs analyst estimates of $12.06 billion (3.3% beat) Operating Margin: 11.7%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 7%, down from 10.4% in the same quarter last year Capex guidance: ""we expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026 "" (>50% year-on-year increase) Market Capitalization: $2.49 trillion “AWS growing 24% (our fastest growth in 13 quarters), Advertising growing 22%, Stores growing briskly across North America and International, our chips business growing triple digit percentages year-over-year—this growth is happening because we’re continuing to innovate at a rapid rate, and identify and knock down customer problems,” said Andy Jassy, President and CEO, Amazon. Revenue Growth Amazon shows that fast growth and massive scale can coexist despite conventional wisdom. The company’s revenue base of $386.1 billion five years ago has increased to $716.9 billion in the last year, translating into an excellent 13.2% annualized growth rate. Over the same period, Amazon’s big tech peers Alphabet, Microsoft, and Apple put up annualized growth rates of 17.2%, 14.8%, and 8.2%, respectively. This is an important consideration because investors often use the comparisons as a starting point for their valuations. When adjusting for these benchmarks, we think Amazon’s price is fair. Quarterly Revenue of Big Tech Companies Long-term growth reigns supreme in fundamentals, but for big tech companies, a half-decade historical view may miss emerging trends in AI. Amazon’s annualized revenue growth of 11.7% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Story Continues Amazon Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Amazon reported year-on-year revenue growth of 13.6%, and its $213.4 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 0.9%. Company management is currently guiding for a 13.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side This projection is admirable for a company of its scale and illustrates the market sees some success for its newer products. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

Profitability: The Key Debate Many investors understand that Amazon’s e-commerce business caps its gross margin, which averaged 46.8% over the last five years. The company lags behind its pure-play tech peers because it sells many commoditized goods online where it must acquire and hold physical inventory. What the market debates, however, is where Amazon’s long-term operating profitability could ultimately settle. Sure, its five-year margin of 7.6% was mediocre, but it rose by 5.9 percentage points thanks to leverage on the fixed costs in its consumer-facing businesses and the highly profitable AWS segment becoming a larger portion of its revenue. Our question is if Amazon’s momentum can continue and result in a mid-to-high teen percentage margin somewhere down the line. Amazon Gross and Operating Margins (GAAP) The company’s North America segment holds the keys to this answer. Throughout the years, Amazon has made huge investments to not only attract hoards of customers into its ecosystem but also retain them. Some areas of focus in this effort included its unmatched delivery network and video streaming content. Bulls will argue that Amazon can afford to ease up and begin riding its investments of the last two-plus decades. Wall Street seems to agree somewhat and is projecting its trailing 12-month operating margin of 11.2% to reach 12.8% in the coming year. Combined with its performance over the last few years, this suggests Amazon’s long-term profitability could go much higher, potentially leading to earnings and a stock price that follows. Key Takeaways from Amazon’s Q4 Results It was encouraging to see Amazon narrowly top analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter, and the beat in Amazon Web Services was a bright spot. And while operating profit missed, all-important AWS segment operating profit beat. On the other hand, its operating income guidance for next quarter missed. Additionally, the company guided to $200 billion of capex in 2026, a more than 50% increase compared to 2025. Overall, this was a mixed quarter with the spending forecast spooking the markets. The stock traded down 5.5% to $210.70 immediately after reporting. The latest quarter from Amazon’s wasn’t that good. One earnings report doesn’t define a company’s quality, though, so let’s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

2026-02-06 10:01:20,QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) Beats Expectations in Strong Q4 CY2025,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quinstreet-nasdaq-qnst-beats-expectations-212336289.html,"In this article: QNST Performance marketing company QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) reported Q4 CY2025 results beating Wall Street’s revenue expectations , with sales up 1.9% year on year to $287.8 million. On top of that, next quarter’s revenue guidance ($335 million at the midpoint) was surprisingly good and 4.5% above what analysts were expecting. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.24 per share was 21.2% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy QuinStreet? Find out in our full research report . QuinStreet (QNST) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $287.8 million vs analyst estimates of $276.2 million (1.9% year-on-year growth, 4.2% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.24 vs analyst estimates of $0.20 (21.2% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $20.98 million vs analyst estimates of $19.43 million (7.3% margin, 8% beat) Revenue Guidance for the full year is $1.28 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $1.23 billion EBITDA guidance for the full year is $112.5 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $101.5 million Operating Margin: 0.4%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 6.3%, down from 12.7% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $654.3 million Company Overview Founded during the dot-com era in 1999 and specializing in high-intent consumer traffic, QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) operates digital performance marketplaces that connect clients in financial and home services with consumers actively searching for their products. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. With $1.11 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, QuinStreet is a small player in the business services space, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and numerous distribution channels. On the bright side, it can grow faster because it has more room to expand. As you can see below, QuinStreet’s sales grew at an incredible 16.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This is a great starting point for our analysis because it shows QuinStreet’s demand was higher than many business services companies. QuinStreet Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. QuinStreet’s annualized revenue growth of 41.8% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated. QuinStreet Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, QuinStreet reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 1.9% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 4.2%. Company management is currently guiding for a 24.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Story continues Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 14.3% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is admirable and implies the market is forecasting success for its products and services. Microsoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend. We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Operating Margin QuinStreet’s operating margin has risen over the last 12 months, leading to break even profits over the last five years. Although this result isn’t exceptional, we can see its elite revenue growth is giving it operating leverage as it scales. This gives it a shot at long-term profitability if it can keep expanding. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, QuinStreet’s operating margin might fluctuated slightly but has generally stayed the same over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. QuinStreet Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, QuinStreet’s breakeven margin was 0.4%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. QuinStreet’s EPS grew at a solid 10.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. However, this performance was lower than its 16.3% annualized revenue growth, telling us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. QuinStreet Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For QuinStreet, its two-year annual EPS growth of 454% was higher than its five-year trend. We love it when earnings growth accelerates, especially when it accelerates off an already high base. In Q4, QuinStreet reported adjusted EPS of $0.24, up from $0.20 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects QuinStreet’s full-year EPS of $0.92 to grow 43.4%. Key Takeaways from QuinStreet’s Q4 Results It was good to see QuinStreet beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. We were also glad its revenue guidance for next quarter trumped Wall Street’s estimates. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 1.6% to $11.24 immediately after reporting. Indeed, QuinStreet had a rock-solid quarterly earnings result, but is this stock a good investment here? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.
