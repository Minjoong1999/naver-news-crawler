Pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts Alternatives to high-yield savings accounts Overview of today's high-yield savings account rates Tips for finding the best high-yield savings account How to open a high-yield savings account HYSA frequently asked questions (FAQs) Why should I open a savings account? Opening a savings account is a smart financial move. For one, these accounts provide a safe place to store your money while earning interest, helping your savings grow over time. Plus, unlike keeping cash on hand or in a checking account, a savings account encourages financial discipline by separating money meant for future goals from everyday spending. And as long as you open an account with a reputable, federally insured bank or credit union, your deposits are protected in case the financial institution fails — up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, per ownership category. Learn more: 6 benefits of opening a savings account you shouldn't overlook What is a high-yield savings account? A high-yield savings account functions similarly to a traditional savings account. The main difference is that HYSAs offer much higher interest rates. In fact, some of the best HYSAs offer annual percentage yields (APYs) 10 times higher than the national average savings account rate . Keep in mind that some banks may require you to maintain a minimum balance to earn interest or avoid a monthly service charge. However, there are plenty of accounts that offer the same rate regardless of your balance and do not charge monthly fees. When shopping around for an HYSA, it's important to compare multiple offers and select an account that fits your needs. Learn more: High-yield savings account vs. traditional savings account: Which one is better? What is APY? A high-yield savings account’s interest rate represents how much you’ll earn in simple interest. On the other hand, the annual percentage yield (APY) is the rate of return including compound interest, which is the interest you earn on both the principal balance and interest you've accrued previously. Most savings accounts compound interest daily or monthly. The more often interest compounds, the faster your money will grow. HYSAs come with variable interest rates. That means your bank or credit union can change your APY at any time. Generally, APYs increase when the economy is doing well, and the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark rate. Conversely, rates can drop when the economy weakens, and the Fed lowers rates. Learn more: What is compound interest, and how is it calculated? What is a good savings account rate? Because savings account rates fluctuate, what is considered a ""good"" rate can change over time. Generally, a savings account that earns more than the national average is considered good. Today, the national average rate is just 0.39%, while the top high-yield savings accounts offer around 3% to 4% APY. Learn more: What is a good savings account interest rate? Do you pay taxes on high-yield savings accounts? Yes, the interest earned in an HYSA is taxable income . You should receive a Form 1099-INT from your bank if you earn more than $10 in interest during the year, which you need to report on your tax return. However, even if you don't receive this form, you are responsible for reporting all interest income to the IRS. Learn more: How to avoid taxes on savings account interest Pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts There are many benefits of opening a high-yield savings account, particularly the opportunity to earn a competitive rate on your balance. However, there are some drawbacks to consider as well. Let’s take a closer look at the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts : Pros: Higher interest rates: You’ll generally earn more interest than you would with a traditional savings account. Compound interest: Compounding interest helps your balance grow more quickly. Interest in an HYSA may compound daily or monthly. Accessibility: These accounts are a great place to stash money you may need to access quickly, such as your emergency fund. Other types of accounts, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), offer high rates but impose penalties if you withdraw money prior to the maturity date. Minimal or no fees: Fees with high-yield savings accounts are rare, so you won’t need to worry about these costs eating into your balance. Low-risk: High-yield savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Plus, unlike investments, account performance isn’t tied to the stock market and you can’t lose money, making HYSAs a low-risk option for your money. Cons: Variable rates: Your savings account’s APY can increase or decrease over time. While individual banks set rates at their discretion, these rates are loosely tied to the federal funds rate. Banks may choose to increase or decrease savings rates when the Fed adjusts its target rate. Minimum balance requirement: Some accounts may have a high minimum opening deposit. Tiered APYs: Some banks may have tiered APYs depending on the deposit amount. For instance, you may earn a higher rate if you deposit $5,000 vs. $100. So, while a $5,000 deposit isn’t necessarily required, it could result in a better APY. Better for short-term savings: High-yield savings accounts aren’t the best choice for long-term savings goals, like retirement. Investment accounts tend to offer higher long-term returns. Withdrawal limits may apply: Depending on your bank, you may have a limit on monthly withdrawals. Read more: Understanding the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts Alternatives to high-yield savings accounts An HYSA can be a smart place to store your savings, but it's not your only option. Here's a look at some of the alternatives you may want to consider. Money market accounts Money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts both offer higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts. However, these accounts come with different features. For instance, MMAs typically offer check-writing abilities and debit cards, though they might require higher minimum balances to earn the top interest rates. High-yield savings accounts, on the other hand, are designed to store your savings longer-term with fewer withdrawal options. Learn more about money market accounts vs. high-yield savings accounts . CDs Like high-yield savings accounts, CDs can provide a safe place to store your savings while earning a competitive return. The big difference is that CDs require you to lock in your money for a set period, known as the term, which can range from a few months to several years. For this reason, CDs are a better option for people who don't need immediate access to their funds. Learn more about high-yield savings accounts vs. CDs . Investing High-yield savings accounts and investing serve vastly different financial goals and risk profiles. HYSAs provide stable, low-risk returns with interest rates higher than traditional savings accounts. They're best for short-term financial goals or emergency funds due to their liquidity and FDIC insurance. Investing in bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and other securities typically involves higher risk — but also the potential for higher returns over the long run. Investing your money makes more sense for long-term financial goals like retirement since the returns generally outpace inflation and help grow wealth over time. Learn more about high-yield savings accounts vs. investing . Overview of today's high-yield savings account rates Today, savings accounts offer competitive rates by historical standards. Even though the national average rate for traditional savings accounts is just 0.39%, the best high-yield savings accounts still pay upwards of 4% APY. Over the past decade, savings account interest rates have experienced significant fluctuations. In the mid-2010s, rates were considerably low — below 1% — thanks to the Federal Reserve's efforts to stimulate economic growth following the 2008 financial crisis. As the economy recovered, the Fed incrementally increased the federal funds rate between 2015 and 2018, leading to a gradual rise in savings account rates. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 prompted a return to near-zero interest rates to support economic activity, resulting in a decline in savings yields. However, this led to a period of rising inflation, so the Fed implemented several rate hikes, contributing to the current higher yields on savings accounts. Even so, rates are now back on a downward trend as the Fed began cutting its target rate again in late 2024. Tips for finding the best high-yield savings account Competitive rates are great, but considering other factors besides APY can help you find an account that best meets your needs. New account offers: Look at high-yield savings account offers for new depositors with high APYs, low to no account fees, and are free to open. High savings account rates will earn you more interest, but the financial institution offering those rates might not necessarily be the best option for your finances, so do your research before opening an account. Required deposits: Research applicable deposit requirements. Is there a minimum initial deposit requirement? Do any other deposit requirements apply? Are there tiered APYs depending on your deposit amount? Fees: Some accounts may have monthly maintenance fees or other fees. Look into which fees may apply before opening a new account. Accessibility: Understand how you can access your money before opening a new account. For example, can you log into an online dashboard? Does your bank have a mobile app? Is it connected to an ATM network? Deposit options: Review available deposit options. Are mobile check deposits via a mobile banking app an option? Can you make direct deposits via an ATM? Account linking: Look into whether you can link your new account to an existing checking account at another bank. Make sure there are no restrictions or waiting periods when it comes to accessing your money. Learn more: How to choose the right high-yield savings account for you . How to open a high-yield savings account Once you’ve determined the best high-yield savings account for you, opening one is simple and can be done in person or online. You’ll generally need to provide your personal information, proof of identity, and address to open a new account. Make sure you have your driver’s license, Social Security number, and copies of a recent mortgage statement or utility bill. Depending on the account, a minimum deposit amount could apply when you open your HYSA account. If that’s the case, you’ll also need to be ready to transfer money from an existing account to meet the deposit requirement. Learn more: How to open a high-yield savings account Frequently asked questions about high-yield savings accounts Is your money safe in a HYSA?

There’s been no single cause, like there was last April when President Donald Trump’s trade war sent markets into a fearful tailspin. Instead, it’s been a slow drumbeat of news that is sowing anxiety about valuations that many suspected had already run up too far — and causing investors to pull back all at once.

He speaks on “Bloomberg The Close.”Source: Bloomberg That was clear again on Thursday, when the S&P 500 slid 1.2%, its third straight daily decline, and the Nasdaq 100 extended its deepest slide since April. Software stocks extended their tumble after artificial-intelligence startup Anthropic rolled out a new model that’s designed to carry out financial research, the second time this week the company has jolted markets, underscoring the competitive threat from the new technology. Silver — which had tracked gold to record highs — cratered 20%. Bitcoin dropped more than 13%, erasing all of the gains seen since Trump’s election 15 months ago, as investors unwound money-losing trades financed with borrowed money. US Treasuries rallied, resuming their usual role as a haven of last resort. And after the closing bell, Amazon.com Inc. plunged more than 11% when it said it plans to invest $200 billion this year, far more than the amount forecast by analysts who’ve grown increasingly concerned that tech companies are overspending on AI. Those jitters spilled into Asian markets on Friday, with South Korean stocks sinking over 5% at one point and chipmakers Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc. among the biggest drags. European stocks slid and Nasdaq 100 Index futures fell 0.4%. “People are definitely going more defensive,” said Brian Frank, president and portfolio manager at Frank Funds. “It’s more of like a shoot first and ask questions later type environment. The recent activity marks a strong shift from the mood on Wall Street heading into the year, when strategists were predicting that stocks were poised for the longest winning streak in nearly two decades. The forecasts rested on expectations that the AI boom would continue, the surprisingly resilient economy would keep bolstering corporate profits and that the Federal Reserve would dial down interest rates. Story Continues That outlook remains largely in place, as evidenced by the solid earnings reports that have been rolling out in recent weeks. But there’s also been a renewed focus on some of the mounting risks: The companies that will be displaced by the AI boom; questions about the direction of the Fed if Trump’s pick, Kevin Warsh, is confirmed as Jerome Powell’s replacement as chair; and stretched valuations — on assets like gold, Bitcoin, or even tech giants like Alphabet Inc. — that may not be sustainable in the long run. Fresh labor-market data also added to the pressure on markets Thursday. New figures from Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. showed companies announced the largest number of job cuts for any January since the depths of the Great Recession in 2009, adding to concerns that economic momentum may be starting to crack. The reversal was most dramatic for Bitcoin. After a meteoric rise for much of last year as Trump’s victory set off a speculative rush into cryptocurrencies, the market for such tokens has tumbled sharply this month as investors yanked out cash. On Thursday, the selloff in Bitcoin deepened as the trading day wore on, dragging down other tokens, exchange-traded funds and the treasury companies like Strategy Inc. that hold vast sums of coins. By late afternoon in New York, it had slumped 13% to just over $63,000, wiping out roughly half its value since it hit a record high four months ago. “The fear and uncertainty across the market is evident,” said Chris Newhouse, head of business development at Ergonia. In the stock market, the drop was more subdued. Yet the pressure was broad based, with nine of 11 major industry groups in the S&P 500 retreating. In addition to the worries about which companies will wind up on the losing end of AI technology, investors have been worried about whether the massive investments in the technology will wind up paying off. That was evident in the drop by Google’s parent, Alphabet, which slipped after outlining an ambitious spending plan even as revenue beat estimates. Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, said the recent retreat is a reflection of the worries that the hottest stocks and the other assets, like gold, had simply run-up too far and were due for a little reckoning. “It’s a reset,” she said. “Momentum may have just strung itself out.” --With assistance from Matt Turner, Boris Korby and Michael Msika.

Parliamentarian Lavu Sri Krishna Devarayalu, whose party is aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s, plans to introduce a private member’s bill in the coming months barring children under 16 from maintaining social media accounts. The aim is to ensure data privacy and protect children and adolescents from exploitation, Devarayalu said in an interview.

State level officials and India’s finance ministry have also raised the issue of potential harms from social media. Any move to limit access to platforms in the world’s most populous nation would be a blow to the likes of Meta Platforms Inc.’s Instagram and Facebook, Snap Inc.’s Snapchat, Elon Musk’s X and more. Australia blocking under-16s from social media has prompted governments around the world to propose following suit, and a similar move by India would be the most significant yet by the number of users affected. Instagram and Facebook each have over 400 million users in India, more than any other country, according to DataReportal, a library of reports on global digital behavior. Snapchat has more than 200 million on its platform there, making India its largest market by users, while X has more than 20 million users, the data shows. While the companies typically earn less revenue per user in India than in more economically developed countries such as the US, India represents unrivaled potential for growth. It is home to the world’s largest remaining pool of untapped digital consumers, with legions of people yet to get online. Devarayalu said responsibility for ensuring compliance would rest with the tech firms. Penalties according to his planned Social Media Age Restrictions and Online Safety Bill could be as much as 2.5 billion rupees ($28 million) or 5% of a company’s global revenue, whichever is lower. “If we can ban apps like TikTok, or the ones for gambling, this can be done easily as well because the resources are there for it,” he said. Story Continues India in 2020 blocked TikTok and other Chinese apps on national security grounds and last year put in place a law banning online gambling. A Meta spokesperson said that the company wants young people to have safe experiences, that it thinks parents should decide which apps teens use, and that bans could push young people toward more dangerous parts of the internet. “We’ll comply with social media bans where they are enforced,” the spokesperson said. Snap and X, along with India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, didn’t respond to requests for comment. Devarayalu, 42, entered parliament in 2019 and is the vice chairman of a group of educational institutions in Andhra Pradesh. The southern state is studying Australia’s ban on children using social media, its minister in charge of technology and human resources said last month. Meanwhile, the IT minister for populous Maharashtra state, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, has ordered a task force be assembled to recommend methods for addressing the harms of social media to children. In a Monday post on X, he cited the “alarming rise in digital addiction among children and its adverse impact on their mental and physical well-being.” The minister, Ashish Shelar, said in an interview on Wednesday that a minimum age hadn’t been specified. Last week, India’s Economic Survey raised age-based restrictions on social media use as an issue for discussion. The annual survey is released by India’s Ministry of Finance and represents an annual report card on the economy and lays out the outlook for the country. Australia in December became the world’s first democracy to initiate such a social media crackdown with its under-16 ban. Several countries have since made similar moves or signaled they’re considering action. Spain’s prime minister on Tuesday said the country would limit social media use for those under 16, and at least six other countries, including France, the UK, and the Netherlands, are weighing similar restrictions.

2026-02-06 18:41:42,"1 Dividend Stock to Buy Now as Trump Tackles Housing Affordability Trump’s push to lower mortgage rates, cap card interest, and curb institutional home buying puts dividend‑payer Lennar at the center of the housing‑affordability trade, with the stock still trading at a modest discount.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-dividend-stock-buy-now-003002470.html,"In this article: LEN President Donald Trump is now openly pushing to make homeownership more attainable by calling for lower mortgage rates and directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a step he argues will help pull borrowing costs down from current levels near 6% on a 30‑year loan. He is also urging Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for a year, down from an average near 21%, to help households save faster for down payments. At the same time, he is seeking to ban large institutional investors from buying single‑family homes so ordinary buyers are not competing with deep‑pocketed landlords.

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else. Amid this news, one established homebuilder has been thrust into the spotlight — Lennar Corporation (LEN). Lennar shares jumped roughly 8% in the past month, following many of these headlines. Still, the bigger question is whether this income‑paying name now offers a compelling way to gain exposure. Let’s dive in. LEN’s Income Backed by Real Numbers Lennar Corporation is a Miami‑based homebuilder designing and constructing affordable, move‑up, and active‑adult homes across the United States. Its equity base stands near $27.9 billion, and it returns cash through a forward annual dividend of $2 per share, which currently implies a yield of about 1.8%. At a share price of $115 as of this writing on Feb. 5, LEN is up about 11% year‑to‑date but down 10% over the last 52 weeks. www.barchart.com The forward price‑to‑earnings (P/E) multiple of 17.39x versus a sector median of 18.20x, alongside a price‑to‑book (P/B) ratio of 1.28x versus 2.67x, points to a modest discount. Lennar's latest financial results, released on Dec.16, 2025, showed total sales of roughly $9.4 billion, up 6.33% year-over-year, while net income fell to about $490.2 million, down 17.04%. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter of $2.03 versus a consensus estimate of $2.23, an 8.97% shortfall, which reflects tighter margins and incentives needed to keep homes moving. The report indicated operating cash flow of roughly $216.8 million for November 2025, more than doubling with 114.05% growth. While overall net cash flow was negative at about $1.16 billion, it still represented a 64.14% improvement from the prior year as LEN invested heavily in land, communities, and its pipeline. Story Continues Lennar Expands Affordable Housing Footprint Lennar is leaning directly into the affordability theme. The company recently began selling homes at River Bridge Ranch, a single‑family community in San Marcos, Texas, aimed at cost‑conscious buyers. Homes there range from 1,200 to 2,780 square feet, with three to five bedrooms and two to three bathrooms. Pricing starts in the mid‑$200,000 range. Each home comes with a standard features package included in the base price, which lines up with the kind of attainable product likely to benefit. Lennar has also been active on the capital‑allocation side. On Nov. 26, 2025, it reported final results of an exchange offer covering up to 33,298,764 shares of Millrose Properties Class A stock, about 20% of Millrose’s outstanding shares, in exchange for Lennar Class A common stock. The offer, which expired on Nov. 21, 2025, was oversubscribed, with 85,296,924 Lennar shares validly tendered and not withdrawn; 84,518,299 were subject to proration, and 778,625 were “odd‑lot” shares accepted in full. Lennar’s Outlook Through Wall Street’s Lens Lennar’s next big check‑in with the market lands on March 19, when it will report results for the quarter ending February 2026. Expectations here are deliberately conservative. The current quarter EPS estimate sits at $0.96 versus $2.14 earned in the same period a year earlier, pointing to an estimated year‑over‑year decline of about 55.14%. Looking a step ahead, for the quarter ending May 2026, the average EPS estimate is $1.41, down from $1.90 last year and implying a year‑over‑year drop of roughly 25.79%. On the rating side, the consensus stance from 19 analysts is a “Hold” — not an outright bullish call but far from a bearish one. The average price target stands at $107.15, compared with the current share price, which implies downside from here. www.barchart.com Conclusion Trump’s renewed focus on housing affordability makes Lennar look like a reasonable dividend name to own rather than avoid. The business is still growing, cash flow is improving, and the balance sheet moves plus affordable communities point in the right direction. Near term, the stock may cool or drift sideways after the recent jump on Trump home headlines. Over the next year or two, the risk-reward still appears tilted slightly higher as policy support and fundamentals gradually converge.

Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $751.2 million vs analyst estimates of $742.4 million (20.8% year-on-year growth, 1.2% beat) Adjusted EPS: $4.79 vs analyst estimates of $4.74 (1.1% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $269 million vs analyst estimates of $263.7 million (35.8% margin, 2% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $780 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $738 million Operating Margin: 26.6%, in line with the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 152, up from 139 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $54.46 billion “Our results demonstrate our continued success in transforming from a chip-only, semiconductor supplier to a full service, silicon-based solutions provider,” said Michael Hsing, CEO and founder of MPS. Company Overview Founded in 1997 by its longtime CEO Michael Hsing, Monolithic Power Systems (NASDAQ:MPWR) is an analog and mixed signal chipmaker that specializes in power management chips meant to minimize total energy consumption. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Thankfully, Monolithic Power Systems’s 27% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth surpassed the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions (which can sometimes offer opportune times to buy). Monolithic Power Systems Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but short-term results matter for semiconductors because the rapid pace of technological innovation (Moore's Law) could make yesterday's hit product obsolete today. Monolithic Power Systems’s annualized revenue growth of 23.8% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Monolithic Power Systems Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Monolithic Power Systems reported robust year-on-year revenue growth of 20.8%, and its $751.2 million of revenue topped Wall Street estimates by 1.2%. Beyond the beat, this marks 8 straight quarters of growth, showing that the current upcycle has had a good run - a typical upcycle usually lasts 8-10 quarters. Company management is currently guiding for a 22.3% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Story continues Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 16.6% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Still, this projection is above average for the sector and implies the market is baking in some success for its newer products and services. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Monolithic Power Systems’s DIO came in at 152, which is 11 days below its five-year average. These numbers show that despite the recent increase, there’s no indication of an excessive inventory buildup. Monolithic Power Systems Inventory Days Outstanding Key Takeaways from Monolithic Power Systems’s Q4 Results It was great to see Monolithic Power Systems’s revenue guidance for next quarter top analysts’ expectations. We were also happy its adjusted operating income outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its inventory levels materially increased. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock traded up 1.5% to $1,175 immediately following the results. So do we think Monolithic Power Systems is an attractive buy at the current price? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

2026-02-06 18:41:50,Amazon Plans Its Own Big Boost In AI Spending. The Stock Is Tumbling. Amazon shares took a hit in extended trading Thursday after the cloud giant missed quarterly earnings estimates and followed peers with a big AI spending forecast.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-plans-own-big-boost-223816356.html,"In this article: AMZN Key Takeaways Amazon shares took a hit in extended trading Thursday after the cloud giant missed quarterly earnings estimates and followed peers with a big AI spending forecast. CEO Andy Jassy said that the company expects a ""strong long-term return"" on its investments. Amazon has big AI spending plans. That isn't helping its stock. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud giant tumbled over 7% in extended trading Thursday after the company missed quarterly earnings estimates and took Wall Street by surprise with a massive spending forecast that landed as investors are increasingly looking for evidence that big AI spending is paying off—and some of its big tech counterparts say they plan to keep shelling out. Amazon ( AMZN ) said its capital expenditures could reach $200 billion this year as it invests heavily in AI and robotics. That was well above the roughly $160 billion analysts expected. Why This Is Significant Several of Amazon's Big Tech peers, including cloud leaders Microsoft and Google , also saw shares take a hit recently after announcing larger-than-expected spending forecasts. CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that the company expects a ""strong long-term return"" on its investments. He pointed to signals of strong demand at Amazon's cloud segment, which recorded its fastest growth in 13 quarters and which Jassy said on Thursdays' conference call would be the main recipient of the company's spending. Amazon Web Services revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $35.6 billion in the fourth quarter, above analysts' estimates. That helped propel Amazon's total revenue for the quarter to a record $213.4 billion. Earnings per share, however, came in just short of the analyst consensus at $1.95. Amazon said it expects first-quarter revenue of $173.5 billion and $178.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were expecting $175.38 billion. The company's report followed another from Google parent Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), which yesterday said it too planned to continue plowing money into AI technology . Amazon's stock, the weakest-performing Magnificent Seven member in 2025, was down about 4% for the year so far through Thursday's close. It finished today around $223, well off Wall Street's consensus price target near $300. Read the original article on Investopedia"

Company Overview With a network of 161 specialized facilities across 37 states and Puerto Rico, Encompass Health (NYSE:EHC) operates inpatient rehabilitation hospitals that help patients recover from strokes, hip fractures, and other debilitating conditions. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Over the last five years, Encompass Health grew its sales at a mediocre 5% compounded annual growth rate. This was below our standard for the healthcare sector and is a poor baseline for our analysis. Encompass Health Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Encompass Health’s annualized revenue growth of 11.2% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting some bright spots. Encompass Health Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can better understand the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its same-store sales, which show how much revenue its established locations generate. Over the last two years, Encompass Health’s same-store sales averaged 4.9% year-on-year growth. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth, we can see the opening of new locations is boosting the company’s top-line performance. Story Continues Encompass Health Same-Store Sales Growth This quarter, Encompass Health grew its revenue by 9.9% year on year, and its $1.54 billion of revenue was in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 8.6% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is commendable and suggests the market sees success for its products and services. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming. Click here to access a free report on our 3 favorite stocks to play this generational megatrend . Adjusted Operating Margin Encompass Health’s adjusted operating margin has risen over the last 12 months and averaged 17.2% over the last five years. Its solid profitability for a healthcare business shows it’s an efficient company that manages its expenses effectively. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Encompass Health’s adjusted operating margin of 17.2% for the trailing 12 months may be around the same as five years ago, but it has increased by 1.8 percentage points over the last two years. Encompass Health Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (Non-GAAP) This quarter, Encompass Health generated an adjusted operating margin profit margin of 16.1%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Encompass Health’s EPS grew at a spectacular 13.6% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 5% annualized revenue growth. However, we take this with a grain of salt because its adjusted operating margin didn’t improve and it didn’t repurchase its shares, meaning the delta came from reduced interest expenses or taxes. Encompass Health Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) In Q4, Encompass Health reported adjusted EPS of $1.46, up from $1.17 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Encompass Health’s full-year EPS of $5.46 to grow 6.1%. Key Takeaways from Encompass Health’s Q4 Results It was good to see Encompass Health beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter despite in line revenue. We were also happy its full-year EPS guidance outperformed Wall Street’s estimates, and this outlook is driving the stock up. Overall, this print had some key positives.

Revenue Growth Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. With $6.28 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, SS&C is one of the larger companies in the business services industry and benefits from a well-known brand that influences purchasing decisions. As you can see below, SS&C’s 6% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was decent. This shows its offerings generated slightly more demand than the average business services company, a useful starting point for our analysis. SS&C Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. SS&C’s annualized revenue growth of 6.8% over the last two years aligns with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was stable. Story continues SS&C Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, SS&C reported year-on-year revenue growth of 8%, and its $1.65 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 1.8%. Company management is currently guiding for a 7.5% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 5.4% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. Despite the slowdown, this projection is above the sector average and indicates the market sees some success for its newer products and services. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

Operating Margin Operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D. SS&C has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a business services business, boasting an average operating margin of 22.8%. Looking at the trend in its profitability, SS&C’s operating margin decreased by 1.7 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. SS&C Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, SS&C generated an operating margin profit margin of 22.3%, down 1.1 percentage points year on year. This reduction is quite minuscule and indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. SS&C’s unimpressive 7.4% annual EPS growth over the last five years aligns with its revenue performance. This tells us it maintained its per-share profitability as it expanded. SS&C Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For SS&C, its two-year annual EPS growth of 15.4% was higher than its five-year trend. This acceleration made it one of the faster-growing business services companies in recent history. In Q4, SS&C reported adjusted EPS of $1.69, up from $1.58 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 5%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects SS&C’s full-year EPS of $6.15 to grow 8%. Key Takeaways from SS&C’s Q4 Results Revenue and EPS both beat, which is a good start. We enjoyed seeing SS&C beat analysts’ full-year EPS guidance expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year revenue guidance exceeded Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The stock remained flat at $74.89 immediately after reporting. Should you buy the stock or not? We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

Viasat (VSAT) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $1.16 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.17 billion (3% year-on-year growth, 1% miss) Adjusted EPS: $0.79 vs analyst estimates of $0.24 (significant beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $387 million vs analyst estimates of $387.2 million (33.5% margin, in line) Operating Margin: 2.3%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow was $444.2 million, up from -$33.17 million in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $5.37 billion Company Overview Operating a fleet of 23 satellites that orbit the Earth and beam connectivity from space, Viasat (NASDAQ:VSAT) provides satellite-based communications networks and services for airlines, maritime vessels, governments, businesses, and residential customers worldwide. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. With $4.62 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Viasat is one of the larger companies in the business services industry and benefits from a well-known brand that influences purchasing decisions. As you can see below, Viasat’s 15.4% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. This is an encouraging starting point for our analysis because it shows Viasat’s demand was higher than many business services companies. Viasat Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Viasat’s annualized revenue growth of 10.2% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Viasat Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Viasat’s revenue grew by 3% year on year to $1.16 billion, falling short of Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4.2% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health. The 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Story continues Operating Margin Operating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses – everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes. Although Viasat was profitable this quarter from an operational perspective, it’s generally struggled over a longer time period. Its expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 5.9% over the last five years. Unprofitable business services companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Viasat’s operating margin decreased by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Viasat’s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn’t pass them onto its customers. Viasat Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, Viasat generated an operating margin profit margin of 2.3%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Sadly for Viasat, its EPS declined by 2.6% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 15.4%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. Viasat Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) We can take a deeper look into Viasat’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Viasat’s operating margin was flat this quarter but declined by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 105%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders. Viasat Diluted Shares Outstanding Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business. For Viasat, its two-year annual EPS declines of 26.7% show it’s continued to underperform. These results were bad no matter how you slice the data. In Q4, Viasat reported adjusted EPS of $0.79, up from $0.11 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Viasat’s full-year EPS of $1.03 to shrink by 27.5%. Key Takeaways from Viasat’s Q4 Results It was good to see Viasat beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its revenue slightly missed. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The market seemed to be hoping for more, and the stock traded down 1.5% to $36.91 immediately after reporting. So should you invest in Viasat right now? The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy.

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.12 per share was 19% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Udemy? Find out in our full research report . Udemy (UDMY) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: On December 17, 2025, Udemy and Coursera entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Coursera will combine with Udemy in an all-stock transaction. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Udemy stockholders will receive 0.800 shares of Coursera common stock for each share of Udemy common stock. Upon the closing of the transaction, existing Coursera stockholders are expected to own approximately 59% and existing Udemy stockholders are expected to own approximately 41% of the combined company, on a fully diluted basis. Revenue: $194 million vs analyst estimates of $193.2 million (3% year-on-year decline, in line) Adjusted EPS: $0.12 vs analyst estimates of $0.10 (19% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $21.45 million vs analyst estimates of $19.67 million (11.1% margin, 9% beat) Free Cash Flow Margin: 6.1%, similar to the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $696.2 million “Udemy demonstrated strong execution in Q4 and throughout 2025, creating tangible momentum toward becoming the system of record for helping companies upskill their workforce in an increasingly AI-driven world,” said Udemy President & CEO Hugo Sarrazin. Company Overview With courses ranging from investing to cooking to computer programming, Udemy (NASDAQ:UDMY) is an online learning platform that connects learners with expert instructors who specialize in a wide range of topics. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Unfortunately, Udemy’s 7.9% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was tepid. This fell short of our benchmark for the consumer internet sector and is a poor baseline for our analysis. Udemy Quarterly Revenue This quarter, Udemy reported a rather uninspiring 3% year-on-year revenue decline to $194 million of revenue, in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 1.9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years.

Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Story Continues Cash Is King Although EBITDA is undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can’t use accounting profits to pay the bills. Udemy has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company’s free cash flow margin averaged 6.9% over the last two years, slightly better than the broader consumer internet sector. Taking a step back, we can see that Udemy’s margin expanded by 21 percentage points over the last few years. This is encouraging, and we can see it became a less capital-intensive business because its free cash flow profitability rose more than its operating profitability. Udemy Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin Udemy’s free cash flow clocked in at $11.79 million in Q4, equivalent to a 6.1% margin. This result was good as its margin was 3 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, building on its favorable historical trend. Key Takeaways from Udemy’s Q4 Results We were impressed by how significantly Udemy blew past analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 2.5% to $4.83 immediately following the results.

2026-02-06 18:59:14,"The job market is off to a rocky start this year, new data shows",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/job-market-off-rocky-start-215946107.html,"A New York Department of Labor job fair at the Downtown Central Library in Buffalo, N.Y., in 2025. (Lauren Petracca / Bloomberg via Getty Images file) · Lauren Petracca New data on jobs and layoffs this week points to more job cuts and lackluster hiring plans, indicating 2026 might not be the fresh start many job seekers are looking for. A monthly survey of layoff announcements from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas released Thursday found that U.S. employers announced 108,435 job cuts in January, the highest cuts for the first month of the year since 2009. Last January, employers announced cuts just shy of 50,000 jobs, according to Challenger. In January 2009, more than 240,000 job cuts were announced. The firm also reported that employers announced the lowest total for hiring plans for the month of January since 2009, the year the firm started tracking the metric. Andy Challenger, chief revenue officer for the firm, wrote that the high cut count signals “employers are less-than-optimistic about the outlook for 2026.” However, JPMorgan noted that comparing the cuts to 2009 could be misleading. “While the report noted that 108k job cuts were the highest for January since 2009, this could be misleading on the severity,” JPMorgan said in a Thursday note. “This January was much more similar to recent January values than it was to 2009.” The bulk of announced cuts came from the transportation and technology sectors, followed by the health care sector, the firm reported, citing job cut announcements from UPS and Amazon. Last week, Amazon announced it would be cutting 16,000 jobs and UPS said it planned to slash up to 30,000 roles. The primary reasons for the January cuts reported by Challenger were cited as lost contracts, market and economic conditions, and restructuring. Only 7% of total January cuts were attributed to AI replacing workers, the firm said. Economist Mohamed A. El-Erian called the data “sobering” in a post on X . “Most notably, these layoffs are occurring while GDP continues to grow at approximately 4%, accelerating the decoupling of employment from economic growth — a phenomenon that, if it persists, has profound economic, political, and social implications,” he added. The release of the most closely watched jobs report for January, by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, was postponed due to the brief government shutdown. The January jobs report will now be released on Feb. 11. Another jobs report from ADP Research released Wednesday estimated that the private sector added just 22,000 jobs in January, driven primarily by an additional 74,000 roles in education and health services. ADP said the slowdown came from cuts in manufacturing, professional and business services and among large employers. Story Continues The Department of Labor on Thursday reported an increase of 22,000 initial claims for unemployment insurance for the week ending Jan. 31, over the previous week. Evercore ISI said in a Thursday note that the unemployment claims should “put some downside pressure on Treasury yields and the dollar.” It estimated that payroll employment increased by around 75,000 jobs last month. However, BLS did release data on job openings and labor turnover for December on Thursday. The bureau reported that nonfarm job openings “continued to trend down” for the month, with a decrease of 386,000 openings. The largest dips came from professional and business services, followed by retail trade and finance and insurance. BLS said openings were down by nearly a million roles over the year. “The job market has continued to reflect a low-hire, low-fire dynamic,” Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said in an emailed statement. “The key question now is whether we’re slipping into a weaker environment.” As BLS prepares to release its official employment report for last month, more layoffs have already begun. On Wednesday, The Washington Post cut a third of its staff. This article was originally published on NBCNews.com"

Additionally, we materially improved the risk profile of the Closed Block, and returned significant capital to our shareholders,” said Richard P. McKenney, president and chief executive officer. Company Overview Tracing its roots back to 1848 when financial security for workers was virtually non-existent, Unum Group (NYSE:UNM) provides workplace financial protection benefits including disability, life, accident, critical illness, dental and vision insurance primarily through employers. Revenue Growth Insurance companies earn revenue from three primary sources: 1) The core insurance business itself, often called underwriting and represented in the income statement as premiums 2) Income from investing the “float” (premiums collected upfront not yet paid out as claims) in assets such as fixed-income assets and equities 3) Fees from various sources such as policy administration, annuities, or other value-added services. Regrettably, Unum Group’s revenue grew at a sluggish 1.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This fell short of our benchmarks and is a poor baseline for our analysis. Unum Group Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within financials, a half-decade historical view may miss recent interest rate changes and market returns. Unum Group’s annualized revenue growth of 3% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, but we were still disappointed by the results. Unum Group Year-On-Year Revenue Growth Note: Quarters not shown were determined to be outliers, impacted by outsized investment gains/losses that are not indicative of the recurring fundamentals of the business. This quarter, Unum Group missed Wall Street’s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 0.1% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $3.24 billion of revenue. Story Continues Net premiums earned made up 80.8% of the company’s total revenue during the last five years, meaning Unum Group barely relies on non-insurance activities to drive its overall growth. Unum Group Quarterly Net Premiums Earned as % of Revenue While insurers generate revenue from multiple sources, investors view net premiums earned as the cornerstone - its direct link to core operations stands in sharp contrast to the unpredictability of investment returns and fees. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming. Click here to access a free report on our 3 favorite stocks to play this generational megatrend . Book Value Per Share (BVPS) Insurers are balance sheet businesses, collecting premiums upfront and paying out claims over time. Premiums collected but not yet paid out, often referred to as the float, are invested and create an asset base supported by a liability structure. Book value per share (BVPS) captures this dynamic by measuring these assets (investment portfolio, cash, reinsurance recoverables) less liabilities (claim reserves, debt, future policy benefits). BVPS is essentially the residual value for shareholders. We therefore consider BVPS very important to track for insurers and a metric that sheds light on business quality because it reflects long-term capital growth and is harder to manipulate than more commonly-used metrics like EPS. Unum Group’s BVPS grew at a tepid 4.7% annual clip over the last five years. However, BVPS growth has accelerated recently, growing by 16% annually over the last two years from $49.91 to $67.11 per share. Unum Group Quarterly Book Value per Share Over the next 12 months, Consensus estimates call for Unum Group’s BVPS to grow by 24.4% to $78.65, elite growth rate. Key Takeaways from Unum Group’s Q4 Results We struggled to find many positives in these results. Its EPS missed and its book value per share fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 7.5% to $70.04 immediately after reporting. Unum Group underperformed this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now?

Additionally, as highlighted last quarter, we continue to invest in AI and broader automation efforts internally to drive greater efficiency and productivity across our business, as evidenced by our increasing free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA margins. I would also like to thank all of our Paylocity teams as they support our clients through our busiest time of year,” said Toby Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paylocity. Company Overview Operating in a field where companies traditionally juggled multiple disconnected systems, Paylocity (NASDAQ:PCTY) provides cloud-based human capital management and payroll software solutions that help businesses manage their workforce and HR processes. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Paylocity grew its sales at a solid 23.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Story Continues Paylocity Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within software, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Paylocity’s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 14% over the last two years was below its five-year trend. Paylocity Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Paylocity reported year-on-year revenue growth of 10.4%, and its $416.1 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 1.9%. Company management is currently guiding for a 7.7% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 6.4% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. The 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Annual Recurring Revenue While reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable. Paylocity’s ARR came in at $387 million in Q4, and over the last four quarters, its growth was underwhelming as it averaged 13% year-on-year increases. This performance mirrored its total sales and suggests that increasing competition is causing challenges in securing longer-term commitments. Paylocity Annual Recurring Revenue Customer Acquisition Efficiency The customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it’s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability. Paylocity is very efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 27.6 months this quarter. The company’s rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs means it can attempt to spur growth by increasing its sales and marketing investments. Paylocity CAC Payback Period Key Takeaways from Paylocity’s Q4 Results We enjoyed seeing Paylocity beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year EBITDA guidance slightly exceeded Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this print had some key positives. The market seemed to be hoping for more, and the stock traded down 1.4% to $125.51 immediately after reporting. So do we think Paylocity is an attractive buy at the current price? The latest quarter does matter, but not nearly as much as longer-term fundamentals and valuation, when deciding if the stock is a buy.

Coty (COTY) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $1.68 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.66 billion (flat year on year, 1.1% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.14 vs analyst expectations of $0.18 (24.2% miss) Adjusted EBITDA: $330.2 million vs analyst estimates of $338.1 million (19.7% margin, 2.3% miss) Operating Margin: 8.8%, down from 16.1% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 30.6%, up from 25.1% in the same quarter last year Organic Revenue fell 3% year on year (beat) Market Capitalization: $3 billion Company Overview With a portfolio boasting many household brands, Coty (NYSE:COTY) is a beauty products powerhouse spanning cosmetics, fragrances, and skincare. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. With $5.81 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Coty carries some recognizable products but is a mid-sized consumer staples company. Its size could bring disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from better brand awareness and economies of scale. As you can see below, Coty’s sales grew at a sluggish 3.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years. This shows it failed to generate demand in any major way and is a rough starting point for our analysis. Coty Quarterly Revenue This quarter, Coty’s $1.68 billion of revenue was flat year on year but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 1.1%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection doesn't excite us and implies its newer products will not accelerate its top-line performance yet.

This metric captures a business’s performance excluding one-time events such as mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures as well as foreign currency fluctuations.

Story Continues Coty Year-On-Year Organic Revenue Growth In the latest quarter, Coty’s organic sales fell by 3% year on year. This decrease represents a further deceleration from its historical levels. We hope the business can get back on track. Key Takeaways from Coty’s Q4 Results It was good to see Coty narrowly top analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also happy its organic revenue was in line with Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its EPS missed and its EBITDA fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 14% to $2.71 immediately after reporting. Coty’s earnings report left more to be desired. Let’s look forward to see if this quarter has created an opportunity to buy the stock. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

2026-02-06 18:59:25,Amazon stock falls after earnings on $200 billion capex plan,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-stock-falls-earnings-200-214541347.html,"In this article: AMZN Amazon’s fourth-quarter earnings had two distinct personalities. The first was the one investors have been paying for lately : a cleaner, sharper Amazon that’s figured out how to make its scale throw off real profit. The second was the one Amazon can’t stop becoming when the next platform shift shows up on the horizon: a company willing to pour concrete, string fiber, and buy chips like it’s trying to build the future faster than anyone can invoice it. Both versions showed up in the same document. The quarter itself was strong. And then CEO Andy Jassy volunteered the sentence that made everything else feel like preamble: “With such strong demand for our existing offerings and seminal opportunities like AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites, we expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026, and anticipate strong long-term return on invested capital.” The market’s response wasn’t “Nice quarter.” It was “Excuse me, you’re spending HOW much?” In a week when investors have started treating AI spending plans the way Americans treat rising restaurant menu prices — with widening eyes and a sudden interest in doing the math — Amazon effectively walked up to order the tasting menu for the whole table. Shares fell as much as 10% in after-hours trading. Big Tech’s capex plans have become the market’s favorite form of indigestion, and a bad tape doesn’t exactly make investors more patient about long-dated payoffs. AWS does the heavy lifting The underlying print was, by most conventional measures, strong. Amazon beat the revenue number analysts were carrying into the report (about $211.4 billion), and AWS came in above expectations. Earnings per share landed at $1.95, a hair below the $1.97 many previews were modeling — the kind of miss that normally gets filed under “within the noise.” Amazon’s framing leaned on momentum: AWS delivered “our fastest growth in 13 quarters,” advertising grew 23%, and custom chips were up triple digits, the company said. But this earnings season has been running on a different fuel. The market is no longer grading these companies on whether they can post big numbers. The market is grading these companies on whether they can explain why the big numbers are worth the even bigger checks. The largest Big Tech players are expected to spend more than $500 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, and investors have started picking favorites based on who pairs spending with clean growth and who pairs it with softer near-term outlooks . Amazon put itself squarely in the second bucket, not because the quarter was weak, but because its guidance invited a heavy dose of skepticism. Story continues The company’s first-quarter operating income forecast — $16.5 billion to $21.5 billion — came in below the $22.04 billion analysts were expecting; operating income is the bridge between “trust us, we’re investing” and “here’s the profit you can actually underwrite.” The same release that celebrated acceleration also warned that Q1 would absorb higher costs, including about $1 billion of incremental “Amazon Leo” expenses year over year, plus investment in faster commerce and sharper pricing in international stores. The capex number, though, is what turned a fairly straightforward earnings story into a referendum. Amazon’s $200 billion figure forces investors to rewrite their free-cash-flow assumptions in real time. The bill comes due The company already told everyone this movie’s first act: trailing-12-month operating cash flow rose 20% to $139.5 billion, but trailing-12-month free cash flow fell to $11.2 billion, driven “primarily” by a $50.7 billion year-over-year increase in property-and-equipment purchases tied to AI investment. Capex isn’t a theoretical risk here . It’s already compressing the numbers investors underwrite. Amazon’s capex has already been running at an eye-watering pace: close to $38 billion in the fourth quarter alone, which makes the 2026 figure feel like quite an acceleration. Heading into the print, capex expectations were clustered well below $200 billion — sometimes closer to $150 billion. A $200 billion plan doesn’t just imply more data centers and more chips. It implies more depreciation, more execution risk, and a longer runway before the cash returns feel obvious. It also raises the question that now hangs over every hyperscaler call: Is this spending being pulled by customer demand or being pushed by competitive fear? The near-term outlook didn’t help. Amazon guided first-quarter operating income to $16.5 billion to $21.5 billion, tied to roughly $1 billion of higher year-over-year costs tied to scaling its low-Earth-orbit satellite effort, plus more investment in quick commerce and sharper pricing internationally. Sales outside North America jumped 17% in the quarter, but operating income slipped to $1 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier. Amazon is still buying growth abroad, even as it asks investors to fun a historic infrastructure build. Amazon made the demand case as hard as it could in its press release. It highlighted an expanding stable of AI offerings and customer wins; it pointed to momentum in its custom silicon, saying Trainium and Graviton have a combined annual revenue run rate above $10 billion; and it described large-scale infrastructure projects meant to ease capacity constraints. That’s all well and great. But investors aren’t disputing that Amazon can spend. They’re disputing the timeline for when spending turns into a cleaner profit and cash narrative — and, for now, some investors aren't willing to take that on faith. There’s a reason AWS remains the emotional center of this story: It generates about 60% of Amazon’s operating profit. When AWS is accelerating, the market is inclined to believe the capex will be absorbed and monetized. When the forward profit guide looks light, the market starts wondering whether the bill is arriving faster than the payoff. Meanwhile, Amazon’s rivals are posting faster percentages — so Amazon can be telling a demand story and still have to act like its playing defense. Amazon wants to be the company that invests like a national utility and earns like a software platform, all while trimming and reorganizing elsewhere to prove it’s still serious about efficiency and margins. In late January, Amazon confirmed 16,000 corporate job cuts as part of a broader restructuring push . So: cut costs in the org chart, spend aggressively in the data center, and ask investors to focus on long-term returns. Amazon is telling investors that it’s choosing to spend — on infrastructure, on speed, on pricing, on a satellite business it’s explicitly flagging as a scaling cost — at the exact moment investors are re-litigating what “responsible” looks like in the AI era. The quarter gave Amazon plenty of ammunition — better-than-expected revenue, stronger AWS growth, solid operating income, and a set of businesses that still know how to scale. The guidance and capex number demand a second, more difficult thing: a credible explanation of pacing and payoff. Now, Amazon has one job: to make the $200 billion feel like an answer to demand instead of a reflex to competition. Investors can tolerate a build year. They just want to know whether they’re funding a backlog or funding an AI arms race."

On the other hand, next quarter’s revenue guidance of $72.5 million was less impressive, coming in 19.9% below analysts’ estimates. Its GAAP loss of $0.04 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Impinj? Find out in our full research report . Impinj (PI) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $92.85 million vs analyst estimates of $92.44 million (1.4% year-on-year growth, in line) EPS (GAAP): -$0.04 vs analyst estimates of -$0.04 (in line) Adjusted EBITDA: $16.43 million vs analyst estimates of $18.14 million (17.7% margin, 9.4% miss) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $72.5 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $90.56 million EBITDA guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $1.95 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $12.78 million Operating Margin: -2.9%, up from -3.9% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 14.7%, up from 9.3% in the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 173, down from 177 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $4.58 billion Company Overview Founded by Caltech professor Carver Mead and one of his students Chris Diorio, Impinj (NASDAQ:PI) is a maker of radio-frequency identification (RFID) hardware and software. Revenue Growth Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Thankfully, Impinj’s 21% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was exceptional. Its growth beat the average semiconductor company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions. Impinj Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but short-term results matter for semiconductors because the rapid pace of technological innovation (Moore's Law) could make yesterday's hit product obsolete today. Impinj’s annualized revenue growth of 8.4% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Impinj Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Impinj grew its revenue by 1.4% year on year, and its $92.85 million of revenue was in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Company management is currently guiding for a 2.4% year-on-year decline in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 22.5% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is healthy and suggests its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance.

We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Impinj’s DIO came in at 173, which is 8 days above its five-year average. These numbers suggest that despite the recent decrease, the company’s inventory levels are higher than what we’ve seen in the past. Impinj Inventory Days Outstanding Key Takeaways from Impinj’s Q4 Results It was good to see Impinj improve its inventory levels, even if just slightly. On the other hand, its EBITDA missed and revenue guidance for next quarter missed. Overall, this was a weaker quarter. The stock traded down 18.4% to $126.09 immediately following the results.

Revenue Growth Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Over the last five years, Molina Healthcare grew its sales at an impressive 18.7% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. Molina Healthcare Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Molina Healthcare’s annualized revenue growth of 15.5% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Molina Healthcare Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can dig further into the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of customers, which reached 5.49 million in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Molina Healthcare’s customer base averaged 50,884,975% year-on-year growth. Because this number is better than its revenue growth, we can see the average customer spent less money each year on the company’s products and services. Story Continues Molina Healthcare Customers This quarter, Molina Healthcare reported year-on-year revenue growth of 8.3%, and its $11.38 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 3.7%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 2.7% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and indicates its products and services will see some demand headwinds. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health.

Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Operating Margin Operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D. Molina Healthcare was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 3.5% was weak for a healthcare business. Looking at the trend in its profitability, Molina Healthcare’s operating margin decreased by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. This performance was caused by more recent speed bumps as the company’s margin fell by 2.9 percentage points on a two-year basis. We still like Molina Healthcare but would like to see it make some adjustments. Molina Healthcare Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, Molina Healthcare generated an operating margin profit margin of negative 1.4%, down 5 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Sadly for Molina Healthcare, its EPS declined by 5.9% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 18.7%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded due to non-fundamental factors such as interest expenses and taxes. Molina Healthcare Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) We can take a deeper look into Molina Healthcare’s earnings to better understand the drivers of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Molina Healthcare’s operating margin declined by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals. In Q4, Molina Healthcare reported adjusted EPS of negative $2.75, down from $5.05 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts’ estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Molina Healthcare’s full-year EPS of $10.65 to grow 26.5%. Key Takeaways from Molina Healthcare’s Q4 Results We enjoyed seeing Molina Healthcare beat analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its full-year revenue guidance missed and its full-year EPS guidance fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 33.4% to $117.85 immediately after reporting. Molina Healthcare underperformed this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now?

Bloom Energy (BE) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $777.7 million vs analyst estimates of $655.1 million (35.9% year-on-year growth, 18.7% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.45 vs analyst estimates of $0.30 (50.4% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $146.1 million vs analyst estimates of $107 million (18.8% margin, 36.6% beat) Operating Margin: 17.1%, down from 18.3% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 50.8%, down from 82.7% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $34.85 billion KR Sridhar, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Bloom Energy said, “Bring-your-own-power has shifted from a slogan to a business necessity for AI hyperscalers and manufacturing facilities. This shift is secular and growing. We have built a solid state digital power platform for the digital age that is superior to any legacy solution.” Company Overview Working in stealth mode for eight years, Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) designs, manufactures, and markets solid oxide fuel cell systems for on-site power generation. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Thankfully, Bloom Energy’s 20.6% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth surpassed the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. Bloom Energy Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. Bloom Energy’s annualized revenue growth of 23.2% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated. Bloom Energy Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can better understand the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its most important segments, Product and Service, which are 82.1% and 7.9% of revenue. Over the last two years, Bloom Energy’s Product revenue (energy servers and electrolyzers) averaged 26.3% year-on-year growth while its Service revenue (operations and maintenance agreements) averaged 12.6% growth. Story Continues Bloom Energy Quarterly Revenue by Segment This quarter, Bloom Energy reported wonderful year-on-year revenue growth of 35.9%, and its $777.7 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 18.7%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 23.7% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection is eye-popping and indicates the market is baking in success for its products and services. The 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Operating Margin Although Bloom Energy was profitable this quarter from an operational perspective, it’s generally struggled over a longer time period. Its expensive cost structure has contributed to an average operating margin of negative 6.3% over the last five years. Unprofitable industrials companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. On the plus side, Bloom Energy’s operating margin rose by 17.6 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. Still, it will take much more for the company to show consistent profitability. Bloom Energy Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, Bloom Energy generated an operating margin profit margin of 17.1%, down 1.2 percentage points year on year. Since Bloom Energy’s gross margin decreased more than its operating margin, we can assume its recent inefficiencies were driven more by weaker leverage on its cost of sales rather than increased marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead expenses. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Bloom Energy’s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last five years. This is a good sign and shows it’s at an inflection point. Bloom Energy Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For Bloom Energy, its two-year annual EPS growth of 151% was higher than its five-year trend. We love it when earnings growth accelerates, especially when it accelerates off an already high base. In Q4, Bloom Energy reported adjusted EPS of $0.45, up from $0.43 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Bloom Energy’s full-year EPS of $0.73 to grow 47.1%. Key Takeaways from Bloom Energy’s Q4 Results It was good to see Bloom Energy beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its EBITDA outperformed Wall Street’s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its Service revenue missed. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 9.1% to $151 immediately following the results. Bloom Energy had an encouraging quarter, but one earnings result doesn’t necessarily make the stock a buy. Let’s see if this is a good investment. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

2026-02-06 10:01:01,Estée Lauder Stock Tumbled 20% Today. Here's What Dragged the Shares Lower,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/est-e-lauder-stock-tumbled-214113017.html,"In this article: EL Key Takeaways Estée Lauder's latest results beat expectations, and the company raised its outlook. Investors, however, didn't like what they saw. After rising more than 45% in the past year, the shares dropped today, finishing 19% lower. Estée Lauder's latest forecast wasn't a winning look. The cosmetics company reported second-quarter results Thursday that sent investors running—and the stock to its lowest close since December—despite results that beat expectations and an improved outlook for the year. The company's reiteration of a $100 million expected second-half tariff hit to profits, along with the stock's steady climb off April lows that may have led to high expectations, likely weighed on the shares. Why This News Matters to Consumers Economists have long said consumers will shoulder most of the cost of tariffs. There has been debate about how long this process may take, as some companies, such as Estée Lauder, acknowledge they have not yet offset the expense. Estée Lauder Cos. ( EL ), parent company of Bobbi Brown and Clinique, hoped to cast its results as long-awaited progress. Sales picked up in Europe, China and other Asian markets. And after 10 years of losing market share, Estée Lauder is gaining ground in the Americas by expanding beyond department stores and selling via Amazon ( AMZN ), Tik Tok and Sephora, CEO Stéphane de la Faverie said on a conference call Thursday. ""One of the main challenges that we see is: the enacted tariffs are starting to hurt consumer confidence in Latin America,"" de la Faverie said, according to a transcript provided by Alpha Sense. ""But overall, I want to say, I feel very strong."" The company reported $4.2 trillion in sales for the quarter ended Dec. 31—a 6% increase from last year, and slightly above the consensus analyst estimate from Visible Alpha. That translated to about $0.89 in adjusted earnings per share, compared to the $0.82 analysts anticipated, per Visible Alpha. Estée Lauder also raised its earnings outlook for the full fiscal year. The company expects to end 2026 with an adjusted operating profit margin of 9.8% to 10.2%, despite a dip in the third quarter due to tariffs and other headwinds. That's up from the 9.4% to 9.9% margin given in prior guidance. Today's investor reaction, however, was deeply negative, with the shares finishing 19% lower even after a bounce from intraday lows. The stock finished Wednesday's session above Wall Street's consensus price target, per Visible Alpha Data; it's now some 15% below it. Read the original article on Investopedia 查看留言"

Guidance for next quarter’s revenue was optimistic at $1.26 billion at the midpoint, 2.4% above analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.44 per share was 2.7% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Microchip Technology? Find out in our full research report . Microchip Technology (MCHP) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $1.19 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.18 billion (15.6% year-on-year growth, 0.6% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.44 vs analyst estimates of $0.43 (2.7% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $337.8 million vs analyst estimates of $324.7 million (28.5% margin, 4% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $1.26 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $1.23 billion Adjusted EPS guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $0.50 at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $0.49 Operating Margin: 12.8%, up from 3% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 26.9%, up from 24.7% in the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 201, up from 198 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $42.28 billion Steve Sanghi, Microchip’s CEO and President commented that, “Our fiscal third quarter results exceeded our expectations, with net sales of $1.186 billion growing 4% sequentially, and 15.6% year-over-year, well above our original guidance. We believe the broad-based recovery across our end markets, combined with significant margin expansion, demonstrates the tangible impact of our nine-point recovery plan execution. Our non-GAAP operating profit grew sequentially more than our net sales did in the December quarter, highlighting the operational momentum we have in our business.” Company Overview Spun out from General Instrument in 1987, Microchip Technology (NASDAQ: MCHP) is a leading provider of microcontrollers and integrated circuits used mainly in the automotive world, especially in electric vehicles and their charging devices. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, Microchip Technology’s demand was weak and its revenue declined by 3.8% per year. This wasn’t a great result and suggests it’s a low quality business. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions. Story continues Microchip Technology Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Microchip Technology’s recent performance shows its demand remained suppressed as its revenue has declined by 28.5% annually over the last two years. Microchip Technology Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Microchip Technology reported year-on-year revenue growth of 15.6%, and its $1.19 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 0.6%. Adding to the positive news, Microchip Technology’s growth inflected positively this quarter, news that will likely give some shareholders hope. Company management is currently guiding for a 29.8% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 21.9% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is noteworthy and indicates its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Microchip Technology’s DIO came in at 201, which is 25 days above its five-year average, suggesting that the company’s inventory has grown to higher levels than we’ve seen in the past. Microchip Technology Inventory Days Outstanding Key Takeaways from Microchip Technology’s Q4 Results We enjoyed seeing Microchip Technology beat analysts’ adjusted operating income expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this print had some key positives. Investors were likely hoping for more, and shares traded down 4% to $75.03 immediately after reporting. Should you buy the stock or not?

StepStone Group (STEP) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Assets Under Management: $220 billion vs analyst estimates of $840.5 billion (22.9% year-on-year growth, 73.8% miss) Revenue: $586.5 million vs analyst estimates of $418.3 million (140% year-on-year growth, 40.2% beat) Pre-tax Profit: -$194.6 million (-33.2% margin) Adjusted EPS: $0.65 vs analyst estimates of $0.62 (4.7% beat) Market Capitalization: $5.06 billion Company Overview Operating as both an advisor and asset manager with over $100 billion in assets under management, StepStone Group (NASDAQ:STEP) is an investment firm that provides clients with access to private market investments across private equity, real estate, private debt, and infrastructure. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Thankfully, StepStone Group’s 34% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. Its growth surpassed the average financials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. StepStone Group Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within financials, a half-decade historical view may miss recent interest rate changes, market returns, and industry trends. StepStone Group’s annualized revenue growth of 47.9% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated. StepStone Group Year-On-Year Revenue Growth Note: Quarters not shown were determined to be outliers, impacted by outsized investment gains/losses that are not indicative of the recurring fundamentals of the business. This quarter, StepStone Group reported magnificent year-on-year revenue growth of 140%, and its $586.5 million of revenue beat Wall Street’s estimates by 40.2%. Microsoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend. We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Assets Under Management (AUM) Assets Under Management (AUM) represents the total value of investments that a financial institution manages for its clients. These assets generate steady income through management fees, creating predictable revenue streams that remain stable so long as clients remain invested with the firm. Story Continues StepStone Group’s AUM has grown at an annual rate of 23.4% over the last five years, much better than the broader financials industry but slower than its total revenue. When analyzing StepStone Group’s AUM over the last two years, we can see that growth decelerated to 21.3% annually. Fundraising or short-term investment performance were net detractors to the company over this shorter period since assets grew slower than total revenue. That said, assets aren't the be-all and end-all due to their unpredictable and cyclical nature. StepStone Group Assets Under Management StepStone Group’s AUM punched in at $220 billion this quarter, falling 73.8% short of analysts’ expectations. This print was 22.9% higher than the same quarter last year. Key Takeaways from StepStone Group’s Q4 Results We were impressed by how significantly StepStone Group blew past analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its AUM missed. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock remained flat at $59.04 immediately after reporting. Big picture, is StepStone Group a buy here and now? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

Its GAAP profit of $0.49 per share was 3.7% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Exponent? Find out in our full research report . Exponent (EXPO) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $147.4 million vs analyst estimates of $128.1 million (19.1% year-on-year growth, 15.1% beat) EPS (GAAP): $0.49 vs analyst estimates of $0.47 (3.7% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $34.71 million vs analyst estimates of $36.08 million (23.5% margin, 3.8% miss) Operating Margin: 19.8%, down from 22% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $3.50 billion “We delivered a strong finish to 2025 reflecting the strength, diversification, and resilience of our portfolio,” stated Dr. Catherine Corrigan, President and Chief Executive Officer. Company Overview With a team of over 800 consultants holding advanced degrees in 90+ technical disciplines, Exponent (NASDAQ:EXPO) is a science and engineering consulting firm that investigates complex problems and provides expert analysis for clients across various industries. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. With $554.8 million in revenue over the past 12 months, Exponent is a small player in the business services space, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and numerous distribution channels. On the bright side, it can grow faster because it has more room to expand. As you can see below, Exponent grew its sales at a solid 8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This shows it had high demand, a useful starting point for our analysis. Exponent Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Exponent’s annualized revenue growth of 5.6% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were respectable. Exponent Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Exponent reported year-on-year revenue growth of 19.1%, and its $147.4 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 15.1%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 4.1% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last two years. This projection doesn't excite us and suggests its products and services will see some demand headwinds. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Story Continues Operating Margin Exponent has been a well-oiled machine over the last five years. It demonstrated elite profitability for a business services business, boasting an average operating margin of 24.3%. Looking at the trend in its profitability, Exponent’s operating margin decreased by 3.5 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Exponent Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, Exponent generated an operating margin profit margin of 19.8%, down 2.3 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Exponent’s unimpressive 6% annual EPS growth over the last five years aligns with its revenue performance. On the bright side, this tells us its incremental sales were profitable. Exponent Trailing 12-Month EPS (GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business. For Exponent, its two-year annual EPS growth of 3.2% was lower than its five-year trend. We hope its growth can accelerate in the future. In Q4, Exponent reported EPS of $0.49, up from $0.46 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 3.7%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Exponent’s full-year EPS of $2.07 to grow 7.8%. Key Takeaways from Exponent’s Q4 Results We were impressed by how significantly Exponent blew past analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock remained flat at $70.83 immediately after reporting. So should you invest in Exponent right now? What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.

Revenue Growth A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Luckily, Doximity’s sales grew at an impressive 29.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth surpassed the average software company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a great starting point for our analysis. Doximity Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within software, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Doximity’s annualized revenue growth of 16.7% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results were respectable.

Company management is currently guiding for a 3.8% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years.

We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Customer Acquisition Efficiency The customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period measures the months a company needs to recoup the money spent on acquiring a new customer. This metric helps assess how quickly a business can break even on its sales and marketing investments. Doximity is extremely efficient at acquiring new customers, and its CAC payback period checked in at 6.4 months this quarter. The company’s rapid recovery of its customer acquisition costs indicates it has a highly differentiated product offering and a strong brand reputation. These dynamics give Doximity more resources to pursue new product initiatives while maintaining the flexibility to increase its sales and marketing investments. Key Takeaways from Doximity’s Q4 Results We enjoyed seeing Doximity beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed and its EBITDA guidance for next quarter fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 32.5% to $22.50 immediately after reporting. The latest quarter from Doximity’s wasn’t that good. One earnings report doesn’t define a company’s quality, though, so let’s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price.

The company expects next quarter’s revenue to be around $106.5 million, close to analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.23 per share was 19.5% above analysts’ consensus estimates.

Power Integrations (POWI) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $103.2 million vs analyst estimates of $103 million (1.9% year-on-year decline, in line) Adjusted EPS: $0.23 vs analyst estimates of $0.19 (19.5% beat) Adjusted Operating Income: $10.02 million vs analyst estimates of $8.13 million (9.7% margin, 23.2% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 CY2026 is $106.5 million at the midpoint, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting Operating Margin: 8.5%, up from 3.7% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 18.6%, up from 11.1% in the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 313, up from 277 in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $2.61 billion Power Integrations CEO Jen Lloyd commented: “I am pleased that we returned to growth in 2025 with a six-percent increase in total revenue, led by our industrial category which grew 15 percent. The growth in industrial was driven by record sales in our high-power gate-driver business, plus strength in metering, power tools, automotive and broad-based industrial applications. Additionally, total revenue from PowiGaN™ products grew more than 40 percent for the year.” Company Overview A leading supplier of parts for electronics such as home appliances, Power Integrations (NASDAQ:POWI) is a semiconductor designer and developer specializing in products used for high-voltage power conversion. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term performance is an indicator of its overall quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Power Integrations’s demand was weak over the last five years as its sales fell at a 1.9% annual rate. This wasn’t a great result and suggests it’s a low quality business. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions. Power Integrations Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within semiconductors, a half-decade historical view may miss new demand cycles or industry trends like AI. Power Integrations’s revenue over the last two years was flat, sugggesting its demand was weak but stabilized after its initial drop. Story Continues Power Integrations Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Power Integrations reported a rather uninspiring 1.9% year-on-year revenue decline to $103.2 million of revenue, in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Company management is currently guiding for flat sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 7.6% over the next 12 months. Although this projection indicates its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.

Product Demand & Outstanding Inventory Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, Power Integrations’s DIO came in at 313, which is 86 days above its five-year average, suggesting that the company’s inventory has grown to higher levels than we’ve seen in the past. Power Integrations Inventory Days Outstanding Key Takeaways from Power Integrations’s Q4 Results It was good to see Power Integrations beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. We were also excited its adjusted operating income outperformed Wall Street’s estimates by a wide margin. On the other hand, its inventory levels materially increased. Overall, we think this was still a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. Investors were likely hoping for more, and shares traded down 3.3% to $45.84 immediately after reporting.

Its GAAP profit of $0.34 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy News Corp? Find out in our full research report . News Corp (NWSA) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $2.36 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.29 billion (5.5% year-on-year growth, 3% beat) EPS (GAAP): $0.34 vs analyst estimates of $0.34 (in line) Adjusted EBITDA: $517 million vs analyst estimates of $498.9 million (21.9% margin, 3.6% beat) Operating Margin: 10.2%, down from 16.3% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 5.6%, down from 6.8% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $14.33 billion Company Overview Established in 2013 after a restructuring, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) is a multinational conglomerate known for its news publishing, broadcasting, digital media, and book publishing. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Unfortunately, News Corp struggled to consistently increase demand as its $8.62 billion of sales for the trailing 12 months was close to its revenue five years ago. This was below our standards and is a sign of poor business quality. News Corp Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or trend. Just like its five-year trend, News Corp’s revenue over the last two years was flat, suggesting it is in a slump. News Corp Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can better understand the company’s revenue dynamics by analyzing its three most important segments: Dow Jones, News Media, and Book Publishing, which are 27%, 25.8%, and 23.6% of revenue. Over the last two years, News Corp’s Dow Jones (media subsidiary) and News Media (general media) revenues averaged year-on-year growth of 6.2% and 1.6% while its Book Publishing revenue (general publishing) averaged 2.1% declines. News Corp Quarterly Revenue by Segment This quarter, News Corp reported year-on-year revenue growth of 5.5%, and its $2.36 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 3%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3% over the next 12 months. Although this projection implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming.

Story Continues Operating Margin Operating margin is an important measure of profitability as it shows the portion of revenue left after accounting for all core expenses – everything from the cost of goods sold to advertising and wages. It’s also useful for comparing profitability across companies with different levels of debt and tax rates because it excludes interest and taxes. News Corp’s operating margin has been trending down over the last 12 months and averaged 10.3% over the last two years. The company’s profitability was mediocre for a consumer discretionary business and shows it couldn’t pass its higher operating expenses onto its customers. News Corp Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, News Corp generated an operating margin profit margin of 10.2%, down 6.1 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. News Corp’s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last five years. This is encouraging and shows it’s at a critical moment in its life. News Corp Trailing 12-Month EPS (GAAP) In Q4, News Corp reported EPS of $0.34, down from $0.38 in the same quarter last year. This print slightly missed analysts’ estimates. We also like to analyze expected EPS growth based on Wall Street analysts’ consensus projections, but there is insufficient data. Key Takeaways from News Corp’s Q4 Results It was encouraging to see News Corp beat analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also happy its EBITDA outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its EPS was in line. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock traded up 1.3% to $24.94 immediately following the results. Big picture, is News Corp a buy here and now? We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

2026-02-06 10:01:18,Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q4 CY2025: Beats On Revenue But Stock Drops,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-nasdaq-amzn-q4-cy2025-212600289.html,"In this article: AMZN GOOG MSFT AAPL Cloud computing and online retail behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q4 CY2025, with sales up 13.6% year on year to $213.4 billion. The company expects next quarter’s revenue to be around $176 billion, close to analysts’ estimates. Its GAAP profit of $1.95 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Amazon? Find out in our full research report . Amazon (AMZN) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $213.4 billion vs analyst estimates of $211.6 billion (0.9% beat) Operating Profit (GAAP): $24.98 billion vs analyst estimates of $25.08 billion (small miss) EPS (GAAP): $1.95 vs analyst expectations of $1.96 (in line) North America Revenue: $127.1 billion vs analyst estimates of $127 billion (small beat) AWS Revenue: $35.58 billion vs analyst estimates of $34.85 billion (2.1% beat) North America Operating Profit: $11.47 billion vs analyst estimates of $10.83 billion (6% beat) AWS Operating Profit: $12.47 billion vs analyst estimates of $12.06 billion (3.3% beat) Operating Margin: 11.7%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 7%, down from 10.4% in the same quarter last year Capex guidance: ""we expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon in 2026 "" (>50% year-on-year increase) Market Capitalization: $2.49 trillion “AWS growing 24% (our fastest growth in 13 quarters), Advertising growing 22%, Stores growing briskly across North America and International, our chips business growing triple digit percentages year-over-year—this growth is happening because we’re continuing to innovate at a rapid rate, and identify and knock down customer problems,” said Andy Jassy, President and CEO, Amazon. Revenue Growth Amazon shows that fast growth and massive scale can coexist despite conventional wisdom. The company’s revenue base of $386.1 billion five years ago has increased to $716.9 billion in the last year, translating into an excellent 13.2% annualized growth rate. Over the same period, Amazon’s big tech peers Alphabet, Microsoft, and Apple put up annualized growth rates of 17.2%, 14.8%, and 8.2%, respectively. This is an important consideration because investors often use the comparisons as a starting point for their valuations. When adjusting for these benchmarks, we think Amazon’s price is fair. Quarterly Revenue of Big Tech Companies Long-term growth reigns supreme in fundamentals, but for big tech companies, a half-decade historical view may miss emerging trends in AI. Amazon’s annualized revenue growth of 11.7% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Story Continues Amazon Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Amazon reported year-on-year revenue growth of 13.6%, and its $213.4 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 0.9%. Company management is currently guiding for a 13.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side This projection is admirable for a company of its scale and illustrates the market sees some success for its newer products. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Profitability: The Key Debate Many investors understand that Amazon’s e-commerce business caps its gross margin, which averaged 46.8% over the last five years. The company lags behind its pure-play tech peers because it sells many commoditized goods online where it must acquire and hold physical inventory. What the market debates, however, is where Amazon’s long-term operating profitability could ultimately settle. Sure, its five-year margin of 7.6% was mediocre, but it rose by 5.9 percentage points thanks to leverage on the fixed costs in its consumer-facing businesses and the highly profitable AWS segment becoming a larger portion of its revenue. Our question is if Amazon’s momentum can continue and result in a mid-to-high teen percentage margin somewhere down the line. Amazon Gross and Operating Margins (GAAP) The company’s North America segment holds the keys to this answer. Throughout the years, Amazon has made huge investments to not only attract hoards of customers into its ecosystem but also retain them. Some areas of focus in this effort included its unmatched delivery network and video streaming content. Bulls will argue that Amazon can afford to ease up and begin riding its investments of the last two-plus decades. Wall Street seems to agree somewhat and is projecting its trailing 12-month operating margin of 11.2% to reach 12.8% in the coming year. Combined with its performance over the last few years, this suggests Amazon’s long-term profitability could go much higher, potentially leading to earnings and a stock price that follows. Key Takeaways from Amazon’s Q4 Results It was encouraging to see Amazon narrowly top analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter, and the beat in Amazon Web Services was a bright spot. And while operating profit missed, all-important AWS segment operating profit beat. On the other hand, its operating income guidance for next quarter missed. Additionally, the company guided to $200 billion of capex in 2026, a more than 50% increase compared to 2025. Overall, this was a mixed quarter with the spending forecast spooking the markets. The stock traded down 5.5% to $210.70 immediately after reporting. The latest quarter from Amazon’s wasn’t that good. One earnings report doesn’t define a company’s quality, though, so let’s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

2026-02-06 10:01:20,QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) Beats Expectations in Strong Q4 CY2025,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quinstreet-nasdaq-qnst-beats-expectations-212336289.html,"In this article: QNST Performance marketing company QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) reported Q4 CY2025 results beating Wall Street’s revenue expectations , with sales up 1.9% year on year to $287.8 million. On top of that, next quarter’s revenue guidance ($335 million at the midpoint) was surprisingly good and 4.5% above what analysts were expecting. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.24 per share was 21.2% above analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy QuinStreet? Find out in our full research report . QuinStreet (QNST) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $287.8 million vs analyst estimates of $276.2 million (1.9% year-on-year growth, 4.2% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.24 vs analyst estimates of $0.20 (21.2% beat) Adjusted EBITDA: $20.98 million vs analyst estimates of $19.43 million (7.3% margin, 8% beat) Revenue Guidance for the full year is $1.28 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $1.23 billion EBITDA guidance for the full year is $112.5 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $101.5 million Operating Margin: 0.4%, in line with the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 6.3%, down from 12.7% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $654.3 million Company Overview Founded during the dot-com era in 1999 and specializing in high-intent consumer traffic, QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) operates digital performance marketplaces that connect clients in financial and home services with consumers actively searching for their products. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. With $1.11 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, QuinStreet is a small player in the business services space, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and numerous distribution channels. On the bright side, it can grow faster because it has more room to expand. As you can see below, QuinStreet’s sales grew at an incredible 16.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This is a great starting point for our analysis because it shows QuinStreet’s demand was higher than many business services companies. QuinStreet Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. QuinStreet’s annualized revenue growth of 41.8% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated. QuinStreet Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, QuinStreet reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 1.9% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 4.2%. Company management is currently guiding for a 24.1% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Story continues Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 14.3% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is admirable and implies the market is forecasting success for its products and services. Microsoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend. We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Operating Margin QuinStreet’s operating margin has risen over the last 12 months, leading to break even profits over the last five years. Although this result isn’t exceptional, we can see its elite revenue growth is giving it operating leverage as it scales. This gives it a shot at long-term profitability if it can keep expanding. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, QuinStreet’s operating margin might fluctuated slightly but has generally stayed the same over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. QuinStreet Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, QuinStreet’s breakeven margin was 0.4%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. QuinStreet’s EPS grew at a solid 10.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. However, this performance was lower than its 16.3% annualized revenue growth, telling us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. QuinStreet Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For QuinStreet, its two-year annual EPS growth of 454% was higher than its five-year trend. We love it when earnings growth accelerates, especially when it accelerates off an already high base. In Q4, QuinStreet reported adjusted EPS of $0.24, up from $0.20 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects QuinStreet’s full-year EPS of $0.92 to grow 43.4%. Key Takeaways from QuinStreet’s Q4 Results It was good to see QuinStreet beat analysts’ EPS expectations this quarter. We were also glad its revenue guidance for next quarter trumped Wall Street’s estimates. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock traded up 1.6% to $11.24 immediately after reporting. Indeed, QuinStreet had a rock-solid quarterly earnings result, but is this stock a good investment here? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

In 2026, it’s been trading more like a meme stock than a safe haven.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-most-boring-investment-started-100047255.html,"In this article: GC=F Gold bars and coins at precious metal dealer Pro Aurum on February 2, 2026, in Munich, Germany. Gold prices have experienced intense volatility in recent weeks. - Sven Hoppe/dpa/picture alliance/Getty Images Gold has been considered a store of value for thousands of years. In 2026, it’s been trading more like a meme stock than a safe haven. Investors often flock to gold when crises hit, inflation spikes or stocks slump as a way to preserve their money’s worth. But gold prices have been extraordinary volatile, smashing through record highs before posting their biggest single-day drop on record last month. Gold is now up roughly 15% this year. Gold has had monster rallies before: Its best year on record was 1979, rising 144% as the US economy experienced rampant inflation and geopolitical tensions surged. And prices rallied 24% in 2020 as the pandemic upended the global economic status quo. This time, gold is benefiting from rising geopolitical tensions. And as traders bought more, the gains gathered steam, resulting in skyrocketing prices. Investing in metals is easier than ever before: Traders can buy and sell exchange-traded funds that track the price of gold and silver just like buying and selling stocks. The SPDR Gold ETF — a popular fund that tracks the performance of physical gold — in August saw its biggest monthly inflows on record, according to FactSet data. US markets in recent years have experienced bouts of so-called meme stock mania , where traders pile into a hype-fueled rally to try and ride a surge in a stock’s share price. Analysts say a similar theme is playing out in the metals market: Gold and silver have been trading like meme stocks. A golden opportunity Gold rose 27% in 2024 and 67% in 2025. The yellow metal hit $4,000 a troy ounce for the first time in October before eclipsing $5,000 in January. “I think there was a wide range of different hedgers, speculators, hedge funds, retail traders, they were all kind of moving aggressively in and actually driving the prices higher than we would have expected and beyond the point where it was sustainable to hold,” said Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist and head of US public policy at the World Gold Council. Despite posting its biggest single-day drop on record on January 30, gold is still up this year. But the recent volatility has made some analysts wonder if gold still has the same luster as an investment. Meanwhile, bitcoin has dropped 50% since hitting a record high above $126,000 in October. Traders who had chased bitcoin’s rally could have shifted focus to metals, analysts say, helping fuel the volatility. “It is distorting gold’s historic role as a haven. It’s now trading like a momentum-driven market at the extremities of the risk asset spectrum,” David Scutt, market analyst at Forex.com, said in an email. Story Continues The fundamental outlook remains positive for gold, economists say. JPMorgan Chase expects gold prices to hit $6,300 a troy ounce by the end of 2026. While traders are trying to cash in on the rally, geopolitical uncertainty persists, boding well for gold prices. Historic volatility Silver has also experienced extraordinary volatility. Silver prices more than tripled across the past year before plunging 31% on January 30 and posting their worst day since 1980 . Silver is still up roughly 138% across the past year. Gold on Tuesday jumped 6.07% and had its best day since 2009 just two days after having its worst day on record. The Cboe Gold Volatility Index surged this year to its highest level since the Covid pandemic in 2020, reflecting the intensity of the metal’s recent volatility. “It’s hard to justify calling something a hedge when it has double-digit swings,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told CNN. “Your hedges are not supposed to be the most volatile portion of your portfolio.” “When you see these kind of declines, they’re spectacular, they’re painful,” he added, “but they’re in some ways the natural outcome of hyper-aggressive speculation.” For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com View Comments"

The premium kids' food company is known for its products, ranging from refrigerated pouches and oat bars to protein bars, puffs, and melts. Its core consumer is kids between the ages of two and five. In the first half of 2025, the company's sales hit $201.6 million, up 64.6% from 2018, as it expanded its offerings and footprint. In 2017, Garner and industry veteran John Foraker joined the company as co-founders alongside Cassandra Curtis, who founded the company in 2015. Garner said at the time that she saw a ""tiny little company"" that offered organic, fresh, refrigerated food that she struggled to find as a mom. Upon meeting Foraker, she said the two shook hands, and the rest is history. The company continues to evolve its product lineup, with a particular focus on protein as Americans dramatically increase their consumption of the macronutrient. ""We're raising our kids alongside our consumers, so we know that protein is ... at the forefront of their minds,"" Garner said.

The company sources about 40% of its ingredients from foreign suppliers, but about 98% of packaging is sourced domestically.

2026-02-06 23:24:17,"Hiltzik: The Dow just broke 50,000. Here's what that means The Dow Jones Industrial Average just crossed 50,000 points for the first time, but that doesn't mean the economy is healthy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hiltzik-dow-just-broke-50-213948067.html,"In this article: ^DJI Trader Chris Lagana works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 50,000 for the first time. (Richard Drew / Associated Press) Round numbers always enchant humans, especially when they're big round numbers. So you'll probably be reading and hearing a lot about how the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed the 50,000-point threshold Friday for the first time. Actually, ""threshold"" isn't the right word. The mark's significance is psychological, if that. In real terms, nothing got triggered at that moment, which happened at about 2:27 p.m. Eastern time. No rules or regulations changed. In and of itself, it won't create a jump-up in anyone's personal net worth. It's doubtful that any trading algorithms kicked in, except those that might have been keyed to a sharp reversal of trading sentiment from earlier in the week, when it was pretty sour . Still, the chances are that attention will be paid. The Dow gained 1,206.95 points or 2.47% Friday, closing at 50,115.67. If you're inclined to make a bet, you might put your money on the likelihood that President Trump or his minions will take this to mean the overall economy is firing on all cylinders, thanks to his policies. It doesn't mean that. So let's dig a little deeper into the meaning of this particular round number. We can start by noting that the Dow not only doesn't rank as a reliable picture of the U.S. economy, it doesn't rank as a picture of the stock market as a whole. It's a price-weighted average of only 30 stocks, with higher priced stocks having a bigger influence on the average, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index tracks, well, 500, and the Nasdaq Composite more than 3,000. (Both those indices moved sharply higher Friday, too.) Read more: Hiltzik: Yes, California should tax billionaires' wealth. Here's why Yet I confess I have a soft spot for the Dow. That dates from the 1980s, when it was treated as more of an economic bellwether than now, and I was the New York financial correspondent for The Times. The Dow had been running up fairly smartly, and I pleaded with the business editor, the revered Paul Steiger, to rescind the rule mandating that I write a story on any day when the average moved 20 points or more. However, I got his agreement that the day it broke 2,000 points for the first time, I would write that story. And I did! That day was Jan. 8, 1987. “It’s a milestone because round numbers intrigue everyone,” Newton Zinder, chief market analyst for E.F. Hutton & Co., told me at the time. William LeFevre, market strategist for the Hartford-based investment firm of Advest, added: “This will bring a lot of little investors into the market, because the publicity associated with it focuses a lot of attention on the Dow.” Story Continues But as I observed then, hullabaloo over ""milestone"" numbers is typically misplaced. The Dow’s first close over 1,000 was greeted with great fanfare on Nov. 14, 1972, when investors and Wall Street professionals read it as a sign that explosive economic growth lay in store for 1973. Market analysts were nearly unanimous in forecasting that the Dow could rise an additional 150 to 300 points within two years. Sadly, no. It took nearly 10 years, or until October, 1982, for the Dow to reach even 1,100. Any optimism the 2,000-point mark inspired also proved to be misplaced. The Dow suffered a major crash of 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987, only nine months later. Comparing the trajectories of the U.S. economy and the stock market over the four decades since Dow 2,000 is an interesting exercise. In the first quarter of 1987, U.S. gross domestic product was $4.72 trillion, or $13.77 trillion in today's dollars. Today it's $31.1 trillion. So the U.S. economy has grown by 558% in nominal terms, or 125% adjusted for inflation. In that same period, the Dow Industrial average has grown by 2,400% in real terms, or an inflation-adjusted 758%. The S&P 500 has grown by 2,588% in nominal terms, or an inflation-adjusted 821%. Read more: Hiltzik: Trump's deal with Nvidia puts our national security up for sale to the highest bidder Dissertations can be written about what these comparative numbers say about, first, the long-term strength of the U.S. economy and, second, whether its majestic growth in wealth is distributed fairly. But they certainly document that corporate and capital valuations have handily outstripped economic growth generally. The bottom line is that few American households feel as if their wealth has grown by 2,400% in the last 39 years, or even 758%. As for whether it's possible to read conclusions about the economy in the Dow Industrial figures, it's hard to discern a clear pattern. For one thing, the 30 components change over time, as the average's owner, a joint venture between Standard & Poor's, and the financial services company CME Group. There's a bit of gamesmanship involved in these decisions — the most recent change, in November 2024, substituted chipmaker Nvidia for chipmaker Intel . The change kept the average consonant with the evolution of the semiconductor market; Intel shares had lost half their value in 2024, while Nvidia had more than doubled, riding the wave of its dominance over the AI chip market. Nvidia validated the average-makers' instincts: Its gain of 7.78% Friday powered much of the average's advance. Big percentage gainers included Caterpillar (up 7.06%), Goldman Sachs (4.31%), JPMorgan Chase (3.95%) and Walmart (3.34%). Somewhere in there may lie truths about the semiconductor, banking, retail and manufacturing sectors, but one day's results probably don't tell the whole story. Nvidia's gain came on the heels of a nasty week — the stock had lost 10% of its value since Jan. 29. History tells us that its unwise to take solid conclusions from short-term action in the Dow or any other index. Friday's gains could mark a lasting recovery from the market meltdown of recent weeks, or could be what market followers call a ""dead-cat bounce,"" and the cat is still dead. For the moment, still, the Dow had a very nice day. That doesn't mean the euphoria will last.

A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the broader market rebounded from a tech-driven sell-off, with investors taking the opportunity to buy stocks at lower prices. This rally was fueled by a recovery in technology stocks and a significant bounce in Bitcoin, which stabilized after losing over half its value from its October peak.

The previous big move we wrote about was 29 days ago when the stock gained 4.7% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations for both revenue and profit. Revenue increased 5.5% from the same period in the previous year to $425.7 million, while adjusted earnings came in at $1.52 per share, with both figures beating Wall Street's forecasts. In addition to the solid quarterly results, management provided full-year revenue guidance of $1.66 billion, which was above analyst estimates. The company also slightly raised its outlook for full-year adjusted earnings per share, signaling confidence in its future performance. Story Continues AZZ is up 18.5% since the beginning of the year, and at $130 per share, has set a new 52-week high. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AZZ’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,568.

A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the broader market rebounded from a tech-driven sell-off, with investors taking the opportunity to buy stocks at lower prices. This rally was fueled by a recovery in technology stocks and a significant bounce in Bitcoin, which stabilized after losing over half its value from its October peak. Investor sentiment was also lifted by a surprising improvement in U.S. consumer sentiment and the realization that massive AI-related capital expenditure, such as Amazon's planned $200 billion, directly benefits chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom.

The previous big move we wrote about was 28 days ago when the stock gained 4.8% on the news that Truist Financial raised its price target on the company's shares to $8 from $6. The analyst firm's decision signaled a more positive valuation for the aerospace company, even as it maintained a ""Hold"" rating on the stock. This indicated that while the firm did not see enough reason to recommend buying the shares outright, it did believe the stock had more room to run than it previously thought. Investors reacted positively to the increased price target, which suggested improved confidence in the company's future value. Story continues AerSale is up 3% since the beginning of the year, but at $7.44 per share, it is still trading 17.3% below its 52-week high of $9 from August 2025.

Wall Street has raised its earnings expectations in recent months, especially for tech companies, which have driven earnings growth in recent quarters.

For the full year, Philip Morris expects earnings per share of $7.87 to $8.02 in 2026, a miss compared to the $8.08 midpoint the Street was looking for.

Thu, February 5, 2026 at 9:18 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Strategy reports quarterly loss as the stock gets crushed by bitcoin sell-off Strategy stock ( MSTR ) tumbled 17% on Thursday before taking another 1% hit after-hours following the release of its fourth quarter earnings. The software company led by Michael Saylor pioneered the model for companies to hoard bitcoin in corporate treasuries. These days, it’s seen as an investment proxy for bitcoin, with that side of the business becoming its organizing principle. The gambit seemed to work last year when bitcoin advanced higher and higher on hopes of easier regulation. But as the sell-off in bitcoin intensified on Thursday, it highlighted the risks in Strategy's long-term holding strategy that could make it harder for the company to raise capital. Strategy currently holds 713,502 bitcoins with an average purchase price of $76,052. On Thursday, bitcoin's spot price fell to around $63,000, bringing the company's unrealized losses to about $8.9 billion. ""HODL,"" Saylor tweeted on Thursday, referring to a tongue-in-cheek term in the crypto community that has evolved to mean ""hold on for dear life."" For the fourth quarter, Strategy reported an operating loss of $17.4 billion, compared to an operating loss of $1 billion in Q4 2024. It also reported a net loss of $12.4 billion, or $42.93 per share, well below the $5.5 billion loss to $6.3 billion profit range the company indicated in December, when it slashed its forecast from a net profit of $24 billion. The Street was expecting a loss of $20.99 per share. In the software operations, revenue increased 1.9% year over year to $123 million, driven by strong growth in product licenses and subscription services. In December, Strategy also created a US dollar reserve worth $2.25 billion, which the company said provides more than two and a half years of funds to cover its dividend. Remarking on the reserve, CFO Andrew Kang said that ""Strategy’s capital structure is stronger and more resilient today than ever before.” Listen to Strategy's earnings call live on the stock quote page. Thu, February 5, 2026 at 1:32 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Peloton posts lackluster quarter amid turnaround efforts Peloton ( PTON ) stock tumbled more than 9% in premarket trading after the connected fitness company reported a lackluster holiday quarter that failed to deliver results and shared that its CFO Liz Coddington would be departing. For the fiscal second quarter, Peloton recorded a basic loss per share of $0.09, wider than the $0.06 loss expected. Revenue was $656.5 million in the quarter, below expectations for $675.1 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Subscriptions to its connected fitness service dropped 7% year over year to 2.66 million after the company raised prices at the beginning of October. Peloton also forecast a challenging quarter ahead as the company transforms its product lineup and tries to stabilize shrinking sales. The company has added new features to its lineup, including a CrossFit training series, as it attempts to revamp offerings. In its fiscal third quarter, Peloton expects subscriptions to decrease by 8% year over year to a range of 2.65 million to 2.67 million. Revenue is expected to come in between $605 million and $625 million, a 1% decline year over year.

Wed, February 4, 2026 at 10:01 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell E.l.f. Beauty stock jumps on upbeat profit guidance E.l.f. Beauty ( ELF ) demonstrated resilience in the fourth quarter following a difficult 2025, with a strong earnings beat and guidance raise. The affordable cosmetics manufacturer lifted its full-year 2026 sales outlook to a range of $1.6 billion to $1.61 billion from its previous range of $1.55 billion to $1.57 billion. The company also sees greater earnings per share of $3.05-$3.10, an increase from the previous range of $2.80-$2.85. The stock soared by as much as 14% in after-hours trading as the company looks to regain its footing after higher tariffs and other challenges led the stock to lose 40% in 2025. However, the stock pared some of those gains, perhaps due to lower gross margins amid ongoing tariff costs. Last year, the company also acquired Hailey Bieber's Rhode brand. In the fourth quarter, e.l.f. reported better-than-expected earnings per share of $0.65 versus $0.55 expected by Wall Street analysts. Net sales jumped 38% to $489.5 million, topping estimates of $461 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""Our value proposition, powerhouse innovation and disruptive marketing engine continue to fuel our brands,"" CEO Tarang Amin said in a statement.

Wed, February 4, 2026 at 9:27 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Qualcomm stock dives as memory chip shortage weighs on financial outlook Qualcomm ( QCOM ) stock fell around 8% in extended trading after the chip designer's results beat on the top and bottom lines but its forecast was lighter than expected. A memory chip shortage stemming from data center developers scooping up chips and chipmakers shifting production to cater to AI demand added pressure to the company's outlook. In the fiscal first quarter, the company said revenue increased 5% year over year to $12.3 billion, while earnings per share rose to $2.78. Qualcomm beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, with consensus estimates forecasting $12.1 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $2.75, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. However, the outlook for the fiscal second quarter dimmed as a supply crunch in memory chips weighs on margins and the smartphone market. Second quarter revenue is expected in the range of $10.2 billion to $11 billion (analysts were looking for $11 billion at the midpoint). Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.45 to $2.65 (the Street was hoping for $2.87). ""While our near-term handsets outlook is impacted by industry-wide memory supply constraints, we are encouraged by end-consumer demand for premium and high tier smartphones, and remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2029 revenue goals,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in the earnings release. Wed, February 4, 2026 at 4:30 PM UTC Jake Conley The backlog just keeps growing,' Eaton CEO says as data center orders tripled During the fourth quarter earnings call for power management giant Eaton Corporation ( ETN ), CEO Paulo Ruiz Sternadt said the company's backlog of orders ""just keeps growing"" and projected a continued firehose of demand as the AI arms race powers on. Data center orders at Eaton roughly tripled in the fourth quarter over the prior year, while the backlog for its ""Electrical Americas"" division grew by 31% quarter-on-quarter to hit a new record, Sternadt said during the call on Tuesday. Eaton's stock price spiked after the report and is up by more than 6% over the past five trading sessions and by more than 16% on the year. Eaton reported fourth quarter revenue at $7.05 billion , outperforming revenue of $6.24 billion from a year ago but falling below analysts' expectations of $7.09 billion. On the bottom line, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.33 per share, outperforming estimates of $3.32 per share. Talking about Eaton's strong order backlog, Sternadt attributed much of the company's success to the demand from AI hyperscalers. ""You probably noticed on recent news from the hyperscalers that they reconfirmed their capex plans for 2026 — this is also great news that supports these projects,"" Sternadt said. ""Multi-tenant and new cloud players, they are so active, never seen them so active as they are today. If I'm to summarize the market picture here, lots of strength, and these projects will take years to complete. So that's what gives us the optimism in the future.""

The highlight of the day was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surged and crossed the historic 50,000 threshold for the first time. The shares closed the day at $14.81, up 8.1% from previous close. Is now the time to buy Rivian? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free . What Is The Market Telling Us Rivian’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 32 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 23 days ago when the stock dropped 9% on the news that UBS downgraded the electric vehicle maker's stock to 'Sell' from 'Neutral', citing a less favorable risk-to-reward outlook. The firm expressed concern that market enthusiasm for Rivian's AI and self-driving technology may have already peaked. An analyst with UBS noted that Rivian's free cash flow burn was likely to increase to $4 billion or more due to higher spending. The downgrade also reflected worries about high expectations for the company's upcoming R2 vehicle launch, with UBS forecasting sales for 2026 and 2027 to be significantly below consensus estimates. This negative sentiment was compounded by reports that the company delivered fewer vehicles in 2025 than in the prior year and came as the broader North American EV market showed signs of slowing, with sales declining 4% in 2025 after some incentives were rolled back. Rivian is down 23.9% since the beginning of the year, and at $14.78 per share, it is trading 34.2% below its 52-week high of $22.45 from December 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Rivian’s shares at the IPO in November 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $146.68. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

2026-02-07 09:28:39,"How London stock market’s big bet on data turned into a disaster Addressing London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) shareholders at the Butcher’s Hall last May, boss David Schwimmer took to the stage to herald the company’s big bet on data.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/london-stock-market-big-bet-070000090.html,"In this article: LDNXF ANTH.PVT For many, the jewel in the crown of LSEG is the London Stock Exchange, founded in 1698 - Toby Melville/Reuters Addressing London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) shareholders at the Butcher’s Hall last May, boss David Schwimmer took to the stage to herald the company’s big bet on data. “We’ve transformed LSEG from a largely European, regional exchange group to a diversified, global leader in financial markets infrastructure and data services,” he boasted. Invest in Gold American Hartford Gold: #1 Precious Metals Dealer in the Nation Learn More Priority Gold: Up to $15k in Free Silver + Zero Account Fees on Qualifying Purchase Learn More Thor Metals Group: Best Overall Gold IRA Learn More Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. Investors hailed his foresight at the time, approving a bumper £7.8m payday for Schwimmer and sending shares to a record high. But now, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have left some investors wondering whether Schwimmer’s big bet on data might be about to unravel and be forever branded as an “AI loser”. LSEG was one of several groups caught up in last week’s software bloodbath following the release of the new Claude AI automation tool from Anthropic, the Silicon Valley tech group. Shares fell to their lowest level in nearly three years, shedding more than 8pc during the week, over fears that Schwimmer had made a bad bet by putting all his eggs into one basket. In moving towards data and analytics and away from its bread and butter role running London’s stock and bond markets, there are growing fears in the market that LSEG has left itself worryingly exposed to disruption from the likes of Anthropic. “This is a week where it’s shoot first, ask questions later,” says Michael Werner, an analyst at UBS. “The challenge here is how long this AI overhang will persist. “So long as it’s there, the shares will not be driven by fundamentals – they will be driven by narratives.” For many, the jewel in the crown of LSEG is the London Stock Exchange, the historic venue founded in 1698 which helped make Britain a global financial centre. Under Schwimmer, a former Goldman Sachs banker, LSEG has been accused of relegating the British stock exchange to a mere bit part in the company’s sweeping data and analytics push. Revenue from data and analytics surpassed £4bn in 2024, accounting for nearly half of all the company’s sales. Its capital markets division, which includes the stock markets, made just £1.8bn or around a fifth of total income. LSEG began beefing up on big data in 2019 by acquiring Refinitiv, the financial information and terminal business, for $27bn (£19.8bn). Several years later, it announced a $2.8bn partnership with Microsoft to develop new data and analytic products in a bid to usurp Bloomberg and its all-encompassing terminal for financial traders. As the threat from AI has grown, LSEG has sought to push even further into data, partnering with a raft of AI companies including Anthropic and ChatGPT. Story Continues Concerns around LSEG’s business model are not new but – like elsewhere in the software and data ecosystem – they have been building in tandem with the rapid advances in AI. “We’re at the stage now with every iteration of GPT or Claude that comes out ... it’s multiples more capable than the previous generation. The market’s thinking, ‘Oh, wait, that challenges this business model’,” Kunal Kothari, a fund manager at Aviva Investors, told Reuters. Others have been cautious about LSEG’s over reliance on data before. Analysts at Barclays said investors wanted to see progress on its tie-up with Microsoft and how much money LSEG might actually make from the numerous partnerships it has recently announced. Werner, maintaining that LSEG was “guilty by association” in the recent sell-off, also said that investors “now need to see the deliverables promised by management before they give the company credit”. The jury is out on whether David Schwimmer’s pivot to data will bear any fruit - Brendan McDermid/Reuters While the sell-off has been brutal , some investors are sticking with the company – at least for now. Kothari said LSEG could succeed in an AI world and there was unlikely to be a stampede towards the latest AI tools. “We have to remember that however good the technology, it is humans that will need to decide whether to adopt it – and they need to be comfortable doing that. Typically that takes longer than you think,” he said. Niall Gallagher, a fund manager from Jupiter, added: “I’ve lived through numerous ‘hype cycles’ before – including the 1998 to 2000 TMT bubble – and whilst technology does change the world, it doesn’t happen overnight.” Gallagher said that LSEG’s core strength was the data it owned that wasn’t available elsewhere and which AI couldn’t replicate. “This does not mean that every single data set or data process inside of LSEG could not be replicated more cheaply by AI, but we do think there is a strong moat,” he said. The jury is out on whether Schwimmer’s pivot to data will bear fruit and if the company’s share price will again hit the heady heights of last year. However, there are concerns LSEG will struggle to escape the perception that it has found itself on the wrong side of the AI boom. “This situation has become slightly self-fulfilling because LSEG achieved this branding as an AI loser,” said Ben Bathurst, an analyst at RBC Capital. “What we find is that in the vast majority of our conversations with participants in the market, with investors or prospective investors in LSEG, it’s widely understood that the sell-off is overdue. “The issue is, it’s very hard to disprove some of these arguments in the short term because we’re talking about something that’s quite long-term in nature.” Try full access to The Telegraph free today.

2026-02-07 09:28:40,"These 3 Dividend Stocks Combine Income, Momentum, and Upside Three dividend stocks with strong buy ratings, solid income today, and upside potential in 2026 based on Barchart strength and analyst consensus.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-dividend-stocks-combine-income-000002928.html,"In this article: ^GSPC With the S&P 500 showing signs of weakness in 2026, income investors face a familiar challenge. It’s easy to find dividend stocks. Just tick basic filters, and then you have it. More News from Barchart 1 Dividend Stock to Buy Now as Trump Tackles Housing Affordability Johnson & Johnson Is a Resilient Blue-Chip Stock and It Just Hit New All-Time Highs How Should You Play the Bloodshed in Stellantis Stock Today? Tired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now! But, it's even harder to find those that still offer upside- and without overpaying. Buying a solid business at the wrong time can cap returns, even when the yield looks attractive on the surface. Remember, yields aren't the only thing investors should be looking at. And that’s why timing and conviction matter. To find these companies, I used Barchart’s Opinion and Opinion Strength indicators, which use short-term technical signals to gauge market momentum, and paired them with strong analyst consensus. This approach helps me find dividend stocks that are paying income today while still showing signs of strength and potential. How I Came Up With The Following Dividend Stocks I used Barchart’s Stock Screener tool to get the list using the following filters. Annual Dividend Yield: Left blank so I can sort it later from highest to lowest. Overall Opinion Strength: Strong - Top 1%. A stronger signal offers a stronger opinion. Overall Opinion % : Buy. Barchart’s short-term technical indicator signals the overall opinion, indicating whether the stock is bullish or bearish. Current Analyst Rating: 4.5 - 5. Companies that are “Strong Buy” according to Wall Street. Number of Analysts: 16 or higher. The more analyst coverage, the greater the confidence rating. Dividend Investing Ideas: Dividend Stocks, Dividend Aristocrats, Dividend Kings. I hit the screen and got 5 results. I will cover three with the highest forward annual dividend yield. Let’s start with the first Dividend Stock: Permian Resources Corp (PR) Permian Resources Corp drills for oil and natural gas in the Delaware Basin, one of the most productive oil regions here in the U.S. The company operates as a pure upstream energy business focused on finding and producing oil and gas. In its most recent financials, the company reported that sales rose 9% YOY to $1.3 billion. However, its net income fell 85% to $59 million due to higher operating expenses and lower commodity prices. Still, Permian Resources has increased its dividends for two consecutive years, paying a forward annual dividend of $0.60, which translates to a yield of around 3.7%. Story continues Meanwhile, Barchart Opinion indicates a 100% overall buy average with maximum strength, suggesting bullish momentum across the short-, medium-, and long-term time frames. Plus, a consensus among 24 analysts rates the stock a “Strong Buy”, with an upside of as much as 28% should it reach the $21 high target price. Valley National Bancorp (VLY) The second Dividend Stock on my list is Valley National Bancorp . The company offers banking services, including loans, deposits, and cash management, to individuals and businesses, with a primary focus on commercial lending to small- and mid-sized companies. In its recent quarterly financial report, sales were down 4% YOY to $827 million while its net income increased 67% to $163 million. Out of that, the company pays a forward annual dividend of $0.44, translating to a yield of approximately 3.3%. Similar to Permian Resources, Barchart Opinion shows an overall 100% buy average with maximum strength, indicating favorable momentum. It also belongs to the top 1% of stocks in both strength and direction. Meanwhile, a consensus among 15 analysts rate the stock a “Strong Buy”. The high target price is $16, suggesting a potential 18% upside from current levels. Coca-Cola Company (KO) The last stock on my list is a Dividend King: Coca-Cola , a company whose products are familiar to consumers almost everywhere. It has a wide portfolio of beverages, including its namesake softdrink. In its most recent financials, the company reported that sales rose 5% YOY to $12.5 billion. Its net income also increased 30% to $3.7 billion. Coca-Cola has also increased its dividends for 63 consecutive years, making it very popular among income investors. Today, it pays a forward annual dividend of $2.04, translating to a yield of around 2.6%. It may not be the highest in this list, but it’s definitely the most stable and resilient. Meanwhile, Barchart Opinion has an overall buy average of 88%, with high strength and direction scores, indicating that there is still further to go. On the other hand, a consensus among 24 Wall Street analysts rates the stock a “Strong Buy”, suggesting there's as much as 27% potential upside should it achieve its $100 high target price. Final Thoughts These three quality dividend stocks have the analyst and Barchart Opinion scores on their side, suggesting bullish momentum across the short, medium, and long terms. That said, technical indicators and analyst ratings are only guides, not the whole story. Always do your own research and decide whether the underlying business and risks align with your investment goals.

2026-02-07 09:28:42,"Dow crosses 50K for first time as stocks enjoy best day since May 2025 Resurgent technology stocks drove the rebound after a volatile week, while bitcoin also recouped losses.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dow-crosses-50k-first-time-232329402.html,"In this article: ^GSPC ^DJI BTC-USD ^IXIC The U.S. stock market roared back on Friday, as technology stocks recovered much of their losses from earlier in the week and bitcoin halted its plunge. The S&P 500 rallied 2% for its best day since May, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 1,206 points, or 2.5%, and topped the 50,000 level for the first time. The Nasdaq composite rose 2.2%. The S&P 500 jumped 134 points to close at 6,932. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,207 to 50,115.67 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 491 points to 23,031. ""Stocks are wrapping up a volatile week of trade on a high note. The S&P 500 has once again bounced directly off support at the 100-day moving average and surpassed resistance at 6,900. Broad-based buying pressure powered today's rally as advancing shares are outpacing decliners by over 3:1,"" Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for LPL Financial, said in an email. Tech companies helped drive the widespread rally, with chipmaker Nvidia jumping 7.8% to trim its loss for the week. Semiconductor company Broadcom climbed 7.1% and erased its drop for the week. The two companies propped up the S&P 500, boosted by hopes for continued spending by customers on artificial-intelligence. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, for example, said late Thursday it expects to spend about $200 billion on investments this year to take advantage of ""seminal opportunities like AI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites."" Such immense spending, similar to what Alphabet announced a day earlier, is creating concerns of its own, though. The question is whether all those dollars will generate profits to eclipse the spending. Amazon's stock dropped 5.6% amid ongoing doubt about whether investment in AI will pay off for tech giants. Even with Friday's surge, the S&P 500 still fell to its third losing week in the last four. Concerns about AI potentially taking away market share from software companies also hurt the market. Software stocks suffered after AI firm Anthropic released free tools to automate things like legal services. Bitcoin rebound Bitcoin, meanwhile, steadied following a weekslong plunge that sent it more than halfway below its record price set in October. It climbed back above $70,000 after briefly dropping close to $60,000 late Thursday. Prices in the metals market also calmed a bit following their own wild swings . Gold rose 1.8% to settle at $4,979.80 per ounce, while silver added 0.2%. Their prices suddenly ran out of momentum last week following jaw-dropping rallies, which were driven by turning to the safe-haven asset amid concerns over mounting global geopolitical uncertainty. Story Continues On Wall Street, the recovery for bitcoin helped stocks of companies enmeshed in the crypto economy. Robinhood Markets jumped 14% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500. Crypto trading platform Coinbase Global rose 13%. Strategy, the company that's made a business of buying and holding bitcoin, soared 26.1%. Improving consumer sentiment Stocks of smaller U.S. companies also helped lead the market, as well as those that depend on U.S. households spending more money, which benefited from encouraging consumer sentiment data. A preliminary report from the University of Michigan suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers is improving slightly, surprising economists. The improvement was strongest among households that own stocks, which are benefiting from the S&P 500 setting a record late last month. ""Market sentiment improved after today's positive report out of the University of Michigan. Median 1-year inflation expectations hit the lowest since January 2025, providing some comfort for investors eager to see improving inflation metrics,"" Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, said in an email. ""We think the markets may have to work through more jitters with a new Fed chair , but in the end, we think the Fed will cut rates later this year, which will grease the skids for more market appreciation."" To be sure, sentiment ""remained at dismal levels for consumers without stock holdings,"" according to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu. Airline stocks strengthened with hopes that more confidence among U.S. households will translate into more spending on trips. That included gains of 9.3% for United Airlines, 8% for Delta Air Lines and 7.6% for American Airlines.

2026-02-07 09:28:44,"Stocks rebound after a dramatic week sparked by ongoing AI uncertainty The S&P 500 rose 1.97%, its best day since May as it rebounded from a week of dramatic selling, triggered by fears of how the AI boom will change the economy.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-rebound-dramatic-week-sparked-225745288.html,"In this article: ^GSPC ^IXIC AMZN MSFT META Traders work on the floor the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York this week. (Michael Nagle / Bloomberg via Getty Images) · Michael Nagle The S&P 500 on Friday rose 1.97%, recording its best day since May, as it rebounded from a week of dramatic selling triggered yet again by the AI boom and what it will mean for the economy, companies and the labor market. The Nasdaq Composite also surged 2.18% on Friday. But the rebound masked a sell-off in many tech names. Shares of Amazon, the fifth largest public company in the world, sank 5.58% after it said Thursday that it planned to spend $200 billion in the coming year. That money is primarily expected to be spent on the Amazon Web Services division, the largest cloud provider in the world. Since Monday, Amazon's stock has plunged 12% and shed more than $310 billion in market value. Two other tech giants, Microsoft and Meta, have met similar fates this week. Both companies also announced hundreds of billions of dollars in planned spending on AI this year. Collectively, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet plan to shell out around $650 billion this year to expand their data center and AI capabilities. Taken together, the four companies shed nearly $1 trillion in market value over the last five days. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also finished the week in the red. But there were definite bright spots. Industrial stocks such as Caterpillar and a handful of energy firms soared on the expectation that their services would be in high demand for data centers. The industrial and energy sectors of the S&P 500 were two of the best performers on Friday. Tech was as well, boosted by chipmakers. Shares of Nvidia also boomed, rising nearly 8%. The AI chip maker is now worth more than $4.5 trillion. After saying earlier this week that the sell-off was ""the most illogical thing in the world,"" Nvidia CEO went on CNBC to back the sector again on Friday. Huang said the stunning levels of spending was appropriate given the ""incredibly high"" demand for AI applications. Likewise, Apple jumped 7% this week. The iPhone maker has been largely spared from recent AI-induced sell-offs because the company buys most of its cloud computing capacity from other firms, rather than build its own data centers. The turmoil started on Tuesday, after AI developer Anthropic announced that AI agents could do advanced tasks such as data analytics. This triggered a panic among investors in the software companies and firms that provide data analysis for industries as varied as real estate, human resources and banking. Fear that AI agents could eat into their businesses prompted heavy selling this week in the sector. Private credit firms, which own many of the big software and data companies, also plummeted this week. These firms play a growing role in helping to raise the extraordinary amount of money that AI and tech giants are seeking to expand. Story Continues The Dow Jones Industrial Average also hit 50,000 Friday for the the first time ever. While the index and each of all-time highs draw lots of attention, the Dow contains only 30 stocks, making it a relatively poor barometer of the overall strength of the markets, relative to an index like the S&P 500. President Donald Trump took to Truth Social to celebrate the Dow milestone, posting: ""CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA!"" For the year, however, the more representative S&P 500 is up less than 1%. Meanwhile, the value of one bitcoin swung nearly $10,000 in the last 24 hours, with the token plunging nearly to $60,000 late Thursday night. By late Friday, it had boomeranged back to more than $70,000. But crypto can often be an outlier to more mainstream assets such as stocks and bonds. ""Crypto is not an asset, and is held by a tiny portion of society,"" UBS Global Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan wrote on Friday. ""It is unlikely that consumer behavior will change because of recent market moves."" Small and medium stocks also well outperformed their larger peers on Friday, soaring almost 4% on the Russell 2000 index. ""We are long Main St., short Wall St.,"" wrote Bank of America analysts on Friday. They suggested that until Trump's approval rating improves, smaller stocks would continue to benefit.

Shares of school bus company Blue Bird (NASDAQ:BLBD) jumped 5.2% in the afternoon session after the broader market rebounded from a tech-driven sell-off, with investors taking the opportunity to buy stocks at lower prices. This rally was fueled by a recovery in technology stocks and a significant bounce in Bitcoin, which stabilized after losing over half its value from its October peak. Investor sentiment was also lifted by a surprising improvement in U.S. consumer sentiment and the realization that massive AI-related capital expenditure, such as Amazon's planned $200 billion, directly benefits chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom. These ""pick-and-shovel"" winners jumped as much as 7%, helping the S&P 500 edge back into positive territory for 2026. The highlight of the day was the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surged and crossed the historic 50,000 threshold for the first time. The shares closed the day at $59.22, up 6.6% from previous close. Is now the time to buy Blue Bird? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free . What Is The Market Telling Us Blue Bird’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 14 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock gained 14.5% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter 2025 results that surpassed analyst expectations on profit and provided an upbeat full-year profit forecast. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.00, comfortably beating the anticipated $0.80. Revenue for the quarter also slightly exceeded forecasts at $333.1 million, a 6.1% increase year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $50.1 million also significantly surpassed estimates. CEO John Wyskiel highlighted that order intake climbed 45% compared to last year, pushing the company's backlog to a seasonally strong level. He also emphasized the company's ability to pass through tariffs and maintain profitability. ""Our Q1 order intake was up 45% from 2025, which pushed our backlog to a seasonally strong 3,400 units,"" Wyskiel stated, reflecting confidence in Blue Bird's positioning despite external pressures. Looking ahead, Blue Bird offered a mixed full-year outlook. While its revenue guidance of $1.5 billion at the midpoint came in slightly below consensus, its adjusted EBITDA forecast of $225 million was ahead of Wall Street's expectations, signaling confidence in its future profitability. Overall, we think this was a decent quarter with some key metrics above expectations. Story Continues Blue Bird is up 26.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $59.22 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $60.86 from September 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Blue Bird’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,534.

Threats of tariffs initially created uncertainty for businesses, as they can lead to higher costs for multinational corporations and disrupt global supply chains.

Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp. and other “hyperscalers” are in an arms race to invest in AI and beat competitors in a technology that could change vast parts of the economy. Google parent Alphabet Inc. said it’s poised to spend as much as $185 billion on data centers this year, more than it has invested in the past three years combined. Amazon.com Inc. promised an even bigger outlay: $200 billion. Most Read from Bloomberg Canadian Province New Brunswick to Quit Using Elon Musk’s X Chicago Office Tower Sells at an 87% Discount to Pre-Covid Price For These Old Bus Stations, It’s Not the End of the Line Milan Olympics Housing Is Built for Easy Reuse In Praise of Urban Disorder A chunk of those investments will come from the high-grade corporate bond market, potentially resulting in more debt sales this year than investors had expected. But the more tech companies borrow, the greater the potential pressure on bond valuations. The securities are already expensive by historical standards, trading at close to their tightest spreads since the late 1990s. “The AI spending bonanza is finding buyers today but leaves little upside and even less room for error,” said Alexander Morris, chief executive officer and co-founder of F/m Investments. “There is no asset class that can’t and won’t spoil.” Those fears weighed on tech companies’ notes this week, which broadly weakened relative to Treasuries, including most of the $25 billion of debt that Oracle sold on Monday. In the broader market, high-grade corporate bond yield spreads edged about 0.02 percentage point wider this week. Beyond supply and demand, intensifying worries around AI’s power to disrupt have sparked tremors in the market. As companies like Anthropic PBC release a steady stream of tools targeting professional services from finance to software development, investors are starting to price in the threat AI poses to entire businesses. Software companies have seen their leveraged loan prices drop about 4% this year through Thursday, according to Bloomberg index data, amid fears that AI will leave many software products obsolete. Publicly traded lenders known as business development companies also have extensive exposure to software, with the industry accounting for more than 20% of portfolios on average, according to a note from Barclays. A BDC equity index fell 4.6% this week. Story Continues In the high-grade and high-yield bond markets, software companies are comparatively less represented, accounting for around 3% of each, according to Barclays. Still, one factor that makes corporate bonds vulnerable to rising risks is valuations, which remain high even with recent weakening. The average US high-grade corporate bond spread was 0.75 percentage point at Thursday’s close, according to Bloomberg index data. “Tight valuations make credit susceptible to potential disruption,” Barclays strategists Brad Rogoff and Dominique Toublan wrote in a Friday note. JPMorgan Chase & Co. in November forecast about $400 billion of high-grade US bond sales from the technology, media and telecom sector this year. But that figure could climb as companies’ spending plans increase. For all the concerns around looming supply, it’s likely that, for now, current demand for investment-grade bonds is even greater. Money has been chasing deals this year even though spreads remain near their tightest in decades. High-grade technicals — market parlance for the balance between supply and demand as revealed by data like dealer inventories and the cash balances of credit funds — have remained robust despite record-setting issuance in the US and across the globe. Funds that invest in high-grade bonds saw $6.44 billion of inflows in the week ended Feb. 4, according to LSEG Lipper, the biggest inflow in over five years. But as these tech giants ramp up their spending plans and sell more debt to fund their AI projects, technicals should continue to weaken, according to Nathaniel Rosenbaum, head of US credit strategy at JPMorgan. Prone to Shocks New issues over the past 10 days have underperformed the JPMorgan US Liquid Index by 4 basis points, the largest such underperformance since October, Rosenbaum wrote in a note Friday. That’s even as dealer inventories remain near record lows. “To the extent issuance picks back up again over the remainder of the month, as we believe it will, there is room for further technical weakness ahead,” Rosenbaum wrote. It’s possible that investors could swoop in and buy bonds as they become cheaper, shifting from either money market funds or mortgage bonds that have generated big gains, said Andrzej Skiba, head of US fixed income at RBC Global Asset Management’s BlueBay Fixed Income, during a Bloomberg TV interview on Friday. Still, the confluence of tech’s borrowing binge, tight spreads and rising credit risks tied to AI make for a potentially precarious environment for investors — and one easily prone to shocks. “It doesn’t take too many adverse events to create a selloff and for the prices to collapse,” said Ali Meli, founder and CIO of Monachil Capital Partners. “While credit markets may appear very liquid when the markets are good, the buyers can quickly disappear.” WATCH: This week’s guests include JPMorgan Asset Management’s Oksana Aronov, Doubleline Capital’s Deputy Chief Investment Officer Jeff Sherman, Oaktree Capital Management’s Danielle Poli, RBC Global Asset MGMT.

Head of BlueBay Andrzej Skiba Click here for a podcast with H.I.G. on distressed opportunities amid the biggest loan slump in years Week In Review A selloff in software debt has pushed billions of dollars of loans into distressed territory, rapidly repricing a market amid the threat of artificial intelligence disruption. Shares of Wall Street’s largest alternative-investment firms plunged, driven by fears that AI-driven disruptions would cause steep losses on their books. Shares of business development companies also fell amid the selloff. Private equity titans are questioning whether the model of snapping up software-as-a-service companies via debt-fueled buyouts is dead. Pain spread to the loan market as well: A group of banks led by Deutsche Bank AG was unable to sell about $1.2 billion of loans backing the acquisition of a software provider. In Europe, two software companies shelved loan offerings amid rising investor unease around the developments in AI. Credit investors should guard against potential downside risks tied to “AI exuberance” after optimism around the technology helped yield premiums drop to their lowest in decades, according to HSBC Bank strategists. And private credit could see default rates surge to as high as 13% in the US if AI triggers an “aggressive” disruption among corporate borrowers, according to UBS Group AG. Global bond issuance has reached $1 trillion in record time as borrowers seize soaring demand to lock in relatively cheap costs. Tech companies in particular are expected to make up a larger share of supply as quarterly results get released and firms emerge from earnings blackouts. Foreign investors bought American corporate bonds at the fastest monthly pace in nearly three years in January, as stable yields and lower hedging costs boosted the appeal of US credit, JPMorgan Chase & Co. data shows. However, BlackRock Inc.’s Rick Rieder said he’s reducing exposure to US investment-grade and high-yield bonds while increasing holdings of emerging-market debt, citing favorable valuations and a soft dollar. Prison-food vendor TKC Holdings Inc. is seeking to raise more than $2 billion to refinance expensive debt, a deal likely to test appetite from investors who’ve historically shunned the for-profit prisons industry. Bank of America Corp. priced a $7 billion sale of investment-grade bonds, adding to a flurry of offerings by major Wall Street banks. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is readying a revised $3.75 billion financing — now likely to include a junk bond offering — to support chemical maker Arclin Inc.’s acquisition of DuPont de Nemours’ Aramids business. Banks are preparing to sell $3.75 billion in debt to back Stonepeak Partners’ acquisition of a majority stake in BP Plc’s Castrol division. A Cipher Mining Inc. subsidiary is seeking to raise $2 billion in the US junk bond market to help fund construction of a data center tied to Amazon.com Inc. Bankers are working on debt packages of around €2.5 billion ($2.9 billion) to back a potential acquisition of Continental AG’s industrial ContiTech unit. Norinchukin Bank is discussing a capital injection into a joint venture that said its estimated loss from debt linked to First Brands Group has ballooned to almost $1 billion. First Brands founder Patrick James will remain free on a $50 million bond partly secured by a Hamptons home as he awaits trial on fraud charges stemming from the collapse of his auto parts supply business. Thoma Bravo raised the stakes in the fight between private equity firms and their lenders, by deploying a loan provision to help smoke out creditor rebellions before they even begin. Private equity owned Multi-Color Corp. won court approval to start tapping a $250 million Chapter 11 loan, defeating a challenge from rival lenders that floated a competing financing. Lenders to bankrupt restaurant operator FAT Brands Inc. want the chief executive officer suspended without pay over a recent stock sale for its Twin Peaks dining chain, deepening a battle for control of the company as it attempts to restructure. Nearly 18 months after lenders to Pluralsight took over the educational-software business, some of them are booking fresh losses on their investments. Nine Energy Service Inc., a Houston-based oil field vendor, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it struggled with high leverage and a shrinking business amid a slowdown in drilling programs. Hong Kong’s largest developer Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. is seeking a loan of at least HK$5 billion ($640 million), returning to the market after skipping its annual refinancing last year. On the Move Eric Beinstein, head of US credit strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co., is retiring after 40 years at the firm. US high-grade credit strategist Nathaniel Rosenbaum will be taking over as head, Beinstein wrote in his daily note on Wednesday. Miguel Picache, the head of Citigroup Inc.’s private placement business, is retiring after nearly 25 years with the bank. The veteran banker will pursue other interests and spend time in the Philippines, he said in a LinkedIn post. Fortress Investment Group managing directors Morgan McClure and Andrew Robbins, who served on the board of formerly bankrupt Red Lobster after a firm-led takeover of the chain, are set to leave both the board and Fortress. UniCredit SpA has hired close to 20 investment bankers from Banco Santander SA’s former Polish unit as it seeks growth in the country.

2026-02-07 23:28:33,"Should You Buy Uber Stock Now for a ‘Multitrillion-Dollar’ Opportunity in Robotaxis? With management betting big on robotaxis as a future growth engine, should you buy Uber stock now?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-uber-stock-now-multitrillion-163236493.html,"In this article: UBER Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just powering chatbots and cloud software. It’s beginning to drive cars, too. Autonomous vehicles (AVs), which once seemed like a futuristic fantasy, are now steadily becoming part of everyday transportation. Among companies leaning hard into this shift is Uber Technologies (UBER), which is rapidly expanding its robotaxi ambitions. Although Uber’s latest quarterly results disappointed some investors due to an earnings miss, management’s growing focus on autonomy may be the more important story shaping its long-term outlook. On its earnings call, management revealed plans to have robotaxis operating in 15 cities by year-end, underscoring the company's determination to lead in autonomy. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi expressed strong confidence that autonomous vehicles would ultimately benefit the entire mobility sector. He also described robotaxis as a meaningful growth driver in markets where they’re already active, specifically highlighting San Francisco, Atlanta, and Austin, Texas, as early examples of traction.

These 3 Dividend Stocks Combine Income, Momentum, and Upside Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines. For now, autonomous vehicles represent just 0.1% of global rideshare trips, whether on Uber’s platform or elsewhere, a tiny slice of today’s market. But the CEO made it clear he sees something much bigger ahead, emphasizing that AV technology could unlock a “multitrillion-dollar opportunity” for Uber over time. So, with management making such bold long-term bets despite near-term earnings pressure, should investors scoop up Uber shares now? About Uber Stock Since launching in 2010, Uber has become a familiar name in ride-hailing, making it possible to book a trip with just a few taps on a phone. What began in San Francisco has expanded into a global platform, with more than 72 billion trips completed and counting. Over time, the company has broadened its focus beyond rides to include food delivery and freight services. By expanding into multiple areas of transportation and logistics, Uber has become a regular part of how many people move around cities and receive goods. Its platform connects riders, drivers, couriers, and businesses, reflecting how digital services are increasingly shaping everyday urban transportation and delivery networks. And now, Uber is sharpening its focus on getting autonomous vehicles all the way to customers’ doorsteps. Story Continues To make that happen, Uber is leaning into a partnership-driven strategy to expand its robotaxi footprint. Most recently, the company teamed up with EV manufacturer Lucid Group (LCID) and self-driving technology firm Nuro, Inc., with plans to help deploy at least 20,000 robotaxis across global markets, a clear step beyond small-scale trials. Also, the company works with Alphabet's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Waymo and May Mobility, both active players in autonomous driving. In addition, chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) provides the high-performance computing technology that helps power advanced self-driving systems. Together, these alliances underline Uber's efforts to build a broad network of partners to support its long-term robotaxi expansion. Currently commanding a market capitalization of roughly $155.3 billion, shares of this ride-hailing giant have posted a respectable return of 6.83% over the past year, edging past the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which has climbed almost 14% over the same period. So far in 2026, however, the ride-hailing stock has hit a bump, slipping nearly 8.5%. Much of the recent volatility followed its latest quarterly results, which failed to impress Wall Street. At the same time, investors are also keeping a close eye on rising costs tied to Uber’s long-term push into autonomous vehicle technology, spending that could weigh on near-term profitability even as it aims to power future growth. www.barchart.com A Look Inside Uber’s Q4 Financial Performance When Uber released its fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results on Feb. 4, investors got a report that showed strong demand but softer profitability, and the market responded with caution, sending the stock down 5.2% that day. Revenue for the final quarter of 2025 rose a healthy 20% year-over-year (YOY) to $14.37 billion, narrowly topping Wall Street’s $14.34 billion estimate and signaling that activity across Uber’s platform remains robust. Much of that growth was driven by its core segments. The mobility business, which includes ride-hailing, brought in $8.2 billion, up 19% from a year ago, while delivery revenue took an even greater leap of 30% YOY to $4.9 billion. Still, earnings didn’t quite meet expectations. Adjusted EPS for the quarter came in at $0.71, a 27% increase YOY but below the Street’s $0.79 forecast. On a GAAP basis, net income totaled $296 million, a sharp drop from $6.88 billion a year earlier. Results were affected by a $1.6 billion net pre-tax headwind tied to revaluations of equity investments, along with higher taxes and the company’s efforts to offer more affordable rides to grow bookings and attract new users. Operationally, however, momentum remained strong. Total trips surged 22% YOY to 3.8 billion during the quarter, fueled by 18% growth in Monthly Active Platform Consumers. Gross bookings also rose an impressive 22% to $54.1 billion, highlighting continued engagement across the platform. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Uber expects growth to remain solid, forecasting gross bookings of $52 billion to $53.5 billion, which would represent 17% to 21% YOY growth on a constant-currency basis. Furthermore, the company guided for non-GAAP EPS of $0.65 to $0.72, implying 37% YOY growth at the midpoint, along with adjusted EBITDA of $2.37 billion to $2.47 billion. How Are Analysts Viewing Uber Stock? Although investors were less than thrilled with the company’s latest quarterly results, Wall Street’s overall stance on Uber remains firmly optimistic. The stock currently holds a consensus “Strong Buy” rating, suggesting analysts largely see recent weakness as short-term noise rather than a break in the company’s long-term growth trajectory. Out of 51 analysts covering the name, 37 rate it a “Strong Buy,” three recommend a “Moderate Buy,” 10 suggest “Hold,” and just one analyst has a “Strong Sell” rating. The average price target of $107.07 points to roughly 43% upside from current levels, while bullish Street target of $150 implies the shares could surge 100% if Uber’s growth strategy plays out as expected. www.barchart.com www.barchart.com On the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

2026-02-07 23:28:35,"3 Oversold Software Stocks You Should Buy on the Dip Now DOCU, INTU, and TEAM are three oversold software stocks that offer significant upside potential to shareholders in February 2026.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-oversold-software-stocks-buy-163002370.html,"In this article: DOCU INTU TEAM The software sector just took a harder hit than at any point in its history, creating opportunities for investors willing to look past the panic. Jefferies recently noted that roughly 73% of software stocks now screen as oversold, the highest reading on record. Even the broader tech universe isn't far behind, with about 45% of names hitting oversold territory. But here's the thing: three names stand out from the carnage with something most beaten-down stocks don't have. DocuSign (DOCU), Intuit (INTU), and Atlassian (TEAM) all show oversold conditions on their RSI indicators while maintaining perfect 100% Barchart opinion scores.

These 3 Dividend Stocks Combine Income, Momentum, and Upside Get exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else. That's a rare combination, suggesting Wall Street analysts still believe in the fundamentals even as traders hammer the stocks. Let's break down why each deserves a closer look. DocuSign: Agreement Management Is the Real Story DocuSign's stock has taken a beating alongside the broader software selloff, but CFO Blake Grayson made a compelling case at the Nasdaq investor conference in December that most people are missing the bigger picture. The company is building what Grayson called Intelligent Agreement Management, or IAM, which addresses everything from preparing agreements to managing them after signature. It crossed 25,000 IAM customers in the most recent quarter, up from just 10,000 in April. That's serious momentum for a product that launched in mid-2025. Grayson explained that the company already has 150 million consented agreements on the IAM platform, providing a significant data advantage. When DocuSign benchmarked queries on public contract data versus their own consented corpus, they achieved a 15-percentage-point improvement in recall precision. ""If you go to ChatGPT and use these LLMs, they're partially accurate,"" Grayson told the conference. ""A 15-point improvement is super valuable, and it provides even more to the trust component that our customers get from using DocuSign."" The company now has nearly 1.8 million customers and relationships with about 275,000 direct sales customers. Most importantly, customers using IAM are using more e-signature volume, creating a flywheel effect that strengthens both businesses. Story Continues DocuSign raised its dollar net retention from a low of 98% roughly two years ago to 102% currently, driven primarily by retention gains since IAM remains too small to drive meaningful expansion yet. Management sees a clear path to high-single-digit or even double-digit growth as IAM scales and churn continues to improve. Out of the 20 analysts tracking DOCU stock, six give it a consensus “Strong Buy,” and 14 recommend “Hold.” The average DOCU stock price target is $85.12, above the current price of about $46. www.barchart.com Intuit: AI Is Transforming Tax and Financial Services Intuit's consumer platform chief, Mark Notarainni, outlined at the Barclays conference how AI is changing TurboTax and Credit Karma, expanding the addressable market. The company declared itself an AI-driven platform seven years ago, well before ChatGPT made headlines. That early investment is paying off now as AI enables true ""done-for-you"" experiences rather than linear interview processes. TurboTax saw a 12% reduction in tax prep time last year by using AI to personalize the experience and only surface relevant questions. The company expects additional refinements this tax season as it works toward enabling 90% of its products with human intelligence augmented by AI. The assisted tax category represents a massive opportunity. About 88 million Americans still file through assisted methods, creating a $37 billion total addressable market. AI is enabling Intuit to move upmarket by making its experts more efficient, allowing them to serve more customers without being bogged down in mundane tasks. Notarainni said developers are 40% more efficient with AI, enabling the company to build products like business tax much faster than previously possible. On the customer success side, Intuit expects $135 million in efficiency opportunities this year, enabling it to serve more customers. Credit Karma is deploying a fleet of AI agents, including a refund assistant to help users make smarter decisions with tax refunds, a debt assistant that works in the background year-round, and Credit Spark to help Gen Z users improve their credit scores through spending-habit analysis. The platform now has 43 million monthly active users across 140 million members, providing multiple touchpoints to drive engagement beyond the seasonal tax business. Out of the 31 analysts tracking INTU stock, 20 recommend “Strong Buy,” three recommend “Moderate Buy,” seven recommend “Hold,” and one recommends “Strong Sell.” The average INTU stock price target is $800, above the current price of about $435. www.barchart.com Atlassian: Customers Are Voting With Multiyear Commitments Atlassian just crossed $6 billion in annual run rate revenue and delivered its first $1 billion cloud revenue quarter, up 26% year-over-year (YoY). But the real signal came from remaining performance obligations, which grew 44% year over year to $3.8 billion. CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes emphasized on the February earnings call that three consecutive quarters of RPO acceleration indicate customers are making long-term bets on Atlassian's platform, not just buying for 2026. ""Those are tens of thousands of seats signing multiyear deals that are voting on not the platform for 2026 for them in AI, but the platform in '27, '28, and '29,"" Cannon-Brookes explained. Atlassian closed a record number of deals greater than $1 million in annual contract value during the second quarter, nearly doubling year-over-year. The company's Rovo AI platform surpassed 5 million monthly active users, with more than 1,000 customers upgrading to the Teamwork Collection and purchasing over 1 million seats. The data shows AI is actually driving more Jira usage, not replacing it. Software teams using AI code-generation tools create 5% more tasks, have 5% more monthly active users, and expand Jira seats 5% faster than those not using AI code-generation tools. Cloud net revenue retention ticked up to 120% for the third straight quarter, showing existing customers are expanding commitments even in a tough environment. Out of the 28 analysts tracking TEAM stock, 20 recommend “Strong Buy,” one recommends “Moderate Buy,” and seven recommend “Hold.” The average TEAM stock price target is $217.40, above the current price of about $98. www.barchart.com The Bottom Line Software valuations remain elevated at roughly eight times sales, so this isn't a sector-wide buying opportunity. But these three names combine technical oversold conditions with strong analyst support and improving fundamentals, suggesting the selloff created real value. The key is distinguishing between stocks that are cheap for a reason and those where fear has disconnected price from business reality.

2026-02-07 23:28:37,"Netflix dominates streaming. No wonder it’s trying to redefine the market As Chairman Mike Lee put it, Netflix could become “the one platform to rule them all” if the merger is allowed to happen.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-dominates-streaming-no-wonder-155801521.html,"In this article: NFLX This week the Senate Judiciary subcommittee responsible for antitrust issues held a hearing on the proposed merger between Netflix and Warner Brothers Discovery . The Monopoly Man in attendance embodied the concern that was top of mind for every committee member: Netflix is already the dominant player in subscription video-on-demand, and its acquisition of Warner Bros. could cement its unrivaled monopoly. As Chairman Mike Lee put it, Netflix could become “the one platform to rule them all” if the merger is allowed to happen. This outcome would harm both consumers of streaming services as well as the talent that generates such compelling content. Not surprisingly, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos tried to deflate concerns by casting a sprawling definition of the relevant market in which Netflix competes. His prepared remarks mention YouTube , Netflix’s purported rival, 25 times. “Including YouTube and the like, Netflix accounts for less than 10% of TV viewing,” Mr. Sarandos insisted. Bruce Campbell, Chief Revenue and Strategy Officer for Warner Bros., added that Netflix competes against short form user-generated content, like TikTok and Instagram . It shouldn’t require an antitrust economist to understand why their comparisons to ad-supported, amateur-produced content are misleading. But here goes one anyway. Just because two services compete for viewers’ attention does not imply that they are in the same antitrust market. If policymakers included all things that vie for viewers’ attention, they would have to include gorgeous sunsets alongside Netflix, YouTube and TikTok in one massive attention market. To define the contours of a market, the courts rely on a hypothetical monopolist test. This test considers whether a single seller of a defined set of products could profitably raise prices of those products by a small but significant amount (called a “SSNIP”) above competitive levels. When performed in merger review, the test is applied initially over the smallest set of products offered by the merging parties. Applied here, one might ask, could a subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) provider raise its prices beyond competitive levels without shedding too many viewers. If yes, then a relevant antitrust market exists, as that provider enjoys pricing power. If not, the market would be expanded to include nearby substitutes, with the test repeated until a profitable price hike is achieved. Evidence suggests Netflix already enjoys substantial pricing power. It has been able to increase the cost of its standard and premium packages by 29% and 39% , respectively, since 2020, while still continuing to amass more viewers. Netflix also charges a price premium relative to its peers, which further indicates power. If it were constrained by user-generated platforms, as the merger proponents would have you believe, then subscribers would cancel their subscriptions in favor of YouTube or TikTok. Yet they haven’t. Story Continues Mr. Sarandos’s and Mr. Campbell’s stories about competing with user-generated platforms don’t pass a sniff test either. Content on YouTube, for example, is overwhelmingly produced by amateur creators—which is a major factor in why such videos are generally free or ad-supported. By contrast, Netflix invests significantly in high-quality content. It plans to spend as much as $20 billion this year . Think of it this way: When a family sits down to movie night, they are not flipping to YouTube. Conversely, when they want a DIY tutorial or a clip of a cat playing piano, they are not opening Netflix. Under a reasonable definition of the SVOD market, Netflix’s market dominance is impossible to ignore. It currently has about a third of all streaming subscribers worldwide. The addition of Warner Bros.’ HBO Max, which controls another 13%, would create a streaming giant with nearly half of all SVOD subscribers. Mix in Warner’s vast content catalogue, and users would essentially have to keep their subscription to access mainstream movies and films. Smaller streamers would likely have to consolidate just to keep up, kicking off a snowball effect in the market. Several lawmakers raised the point that such control would give Netflix immense power to push an ideological agenda. While the debate over Netflix’s “wokeism” at the hearing might be ancillary to traditional antitrust concerns, it warrants consideration whether any one company should have that kind of unilateral control over what content viewers receive. As Mr. Sarandos and Mr. Campbell both pointed out, entertainment shapes culture. Netflix is the number one SVOD provider, with 325 million subscribers globally. Warner Bros., with 125 million subscribers, is the fourth largest. Putting these two giant streaming services under one roof is the epitome of a horizontal merger that would hurt consumers. It would confer significant power to raise prices and stifle competition. No amount of CEO spin can change those basic facts. The question now turns to whether Trump’s antitrust enforcers will buy what Netflix is selling, and if not, how the Warner Bros. board will respond?

But as early signals suggest the cycle may finally be inflecting upward, recent earnings calls from RXO and C.H. Robinson offer a timely warning: a rising market does not automatically mean an easier one. In fact, the transition phase may be where financial and operational stress becomes most acute. RXO’s fourth-quarter results showed just how fragile broker economics remain. The company pointed to continued pricing pressure, margin compression and the challenge of balancing carrier costs against still-cautious shipper demand. FreightWaves’ John Kingston writes, “Those various results show what happens when the freight market suddenly gets stronger, as it did in the last four to five weeks of the quarter, and 3PLs face the reality of filling earlier booked capacity with higher-priced truckload rates.” Brokers often struggle most not at the bottom of the cycle, but as it begins to move. RXO’s commentary fits that pattern. Capacity remains readily available in many lanes, but it is no longer uniformly cheap. Spot rates can move quickly, contract rates lag behind, and brokers caught between the two are forced to make uncomfortable decisions about margin sacrifice versus customer retention. That tension is likely to intensify as 2026 unfolds. Where Brokers Feel the Pressure First One of the clearest risks in an upward-inflating market is working capital strain. As carrier rates firm faster than shipper pricing, brokers are asked to float higher payments while waiting for contractual adjustments to catch up. For large, well-capitalized players, this is manageable. RXO acknowledged this dynamic indirectly, emphasizing discipline around pricing and lane selection. The message was subtle but important: not all freight is worth chasing in a turn. Growth without margin is still just risk. As reported in RXO’s fourth quarter call, “The bottom line GAAP net loss was $46 million in the fourth quarter. That was more than a $25 million GAAP net loss in the fourth quarter of 2024, and $14 million in the third quarter.” SONAR. Spot (linehaul) to contract rate spread Another stress point is operational. Rising volatility rewards brokers with strong carrier relationships and real-time visibility into lane-level pricing. Those relying too heavily on static models or national averages are more likely to misprice freight and pay for it later. Why C.H. Robinson Looks Different The contrast with C.H. Robinson is revealing. Despite ongoing headwinds, Robinson’s earnings calls struck a notably different tone. While management acknowledged the tough environment, the company highlighted productivity gains, cost discipline and improved execution. The market responded accordingly, sending the stock higher even as freight fundamentals remained mixed. Story Continues C.H. Robinson, CFO  Damon Lee said the North American Surfact Transport group is “still on a very good trajectory to get to that 40% target. We’ll make an earnings growth and quality of earnings growth decision on whether we continue to expand margins at that point, or whether we reinvest that into demonstrable growth.” The difference is not simply scale, though scale helps. Robinson has spent the downturn restructuring operations, investing in technology and reducing headcount to better align with demand. That has given it flexibility heading into a turn, the ability to absorb short-term margin pressure without losing strategic footing. XEO of C.H. Robinson, Dave Bozeman said, “There could be a ‘shift’ in the headcount, because we are shifting to a more customer-focused and automating largely through AI processes that have a lot of friction and a lot of entry-level headcount. And for some of that, we’re not backfilling.” What Brokers Should Be Watching Now As signals of recovery build, brokers would be wise to focus less on headline rate increases and more on the mechanics underneath them. Lane-by-lane volatility, customer mix and carrier loyalty will matter more than broad market direction. Equally important is credit exposure. Shippers slow to adjust rates upward may also be slow to pay, compounding cash flow challenges. Brokers who tighten credit terms or proactively manage receivables may find themselves better positioned when conditions tighten further. Finally, the RXO and Robinson results both point to a hard truth: the market’s next phase will reward execution, not optimism. The easy money of past upcycles is unlikely to return in the same form.

2026-02-07 23:28:42,"​​The Two Minutes That Made Traders Lose Faith in the Gas Market During a record-breaking surge in gas futures on Jan. 27, the New York Mercantile Exchange imposed an extraordinary 2-minute trading halt during the market close that skewed the settlement price and confounded traders already exercised over a demand outlook that had been upended by cold weather.  The market pause, which should have lasted only five seconds, was the ninth circuit breaker triggered in the past day.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/two-minutes-made-traders-lose-130007026.html,"In this article: CME NG=F BGC (Bloomberg) -- More than a week after an extreme bout of volatility roiled the US natural gas market, traders are still fuming over a glitch they say sowed chaos in a key commodity market. Most Read from Bloomberg Canadian Province New Brunswick to Quit Using Elon Musk’s X Chicago Office Tower Sells at an 87% Discount to Pre-Covid Price For These Old Bus Stations, It’s Not the End of the Line Milan Olympics Housing Is Built for Easy Reuse In Praise of Urban Disorder During a record-breaking surge in gas futures on Jan. 27, the New York Mercantile Exchange imposed an extraordinary 2-minute trading halt during the market close that skewed the settlement price and confounded traders already exercised over a demand outlook that had been upended by cold weather. The market pause, which should have lasted only five seconds, was the ninth circuit breaker triggered in the past day. ""Something clearly did not operate the way that it should have that day and it is highly likely it impacted the day’s economics,"" George Cultraro, Head of Global Commodities Trading at Bank of America said in an interview. For some investors the incident meant losses, while others were left with concern about the integrity of the market, according to interviews with 10 traders. The CME Group Inc., which owns Nymex, informed traders that a “technical error” had caused the circuit breaker to last longer than the usual five seconds. But for many investors, the incident was emblematic of a market plagued with issues. Natural gas has grown extremely volatile as US liquefied natural gas exports and the artificial intelligence boom supercharge demand. Futures prices had surged 119% during Jan. 20-26, a 35-year record for the period, before logging the biggest single-day crash on a percentage basis in 30 years the following week. Now, investors are demanding answers from CME, as well as from regulators. What caused the glitch? What recourse do they have to recoup losses? And haven’t the powers-that-be noticed that pervasive illiquidity heading into contract expiration can cause wild price swings that short-circuit the exchange’s market mechanism? CME said in a statement that it has addressed the technical issue behind the circuit breaker but declined to comment on the reasons for the malfunction, or its impact on investors. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said that market moves, and thus the circuit breakers, appeared to be “consistent with recent supply and demand fluctuation.” The agency added that it’s “continuing to evaluate related trading activity.” Story Continues Lottery Ticket Losses The chaos stemming from the mishap rippled beyond gas  futures. In the options market leading up to that day, tens of thousands of “lottery- ticket” bets had been placed on gas ending the day above $7 per British thermal units. If those positions remained open and had settled at $7.20 (as suggested by the bids and offers during the halt,) the play could have yielded a $40 million jackpot for a bet that in mid-January was nearly worthless. The window for a win was extremely narrow but, heading into the close, odds were good. Prices had crashed through the $7 level and then furiously rallied to $7.31 with 68 seconds to go before the end of the settlement period. Then came the circuit breaker. Though investors were flying blind, bids and offers continued to stream in which, if executed, would have driven the price to $7.40, according to traders. But because the trading halt lasted so long – only lifting after the market close – those transactions weren’t fulfilled. The settlement price posted at $6.95, rendering the lottery ticket options worthless. CME declined to share data on how many positions remained open at the close. “The exchange having a pause during options expiry was quite absurd,” said Bill Perkins, founder of Skylar Capital. “That caused a lot of issues for market participants which are still being worked through.” At least one investor caught out by the incident — and who asked not to be named discussing private matters — complained to CME and said the agency advised filing a complaint to seek recovery of losses. But because it would be difficult to prove what would have happened during those two minutes had trading not frozen, the investor said recouping anything would be unlikely. ‘Banging the Close’ While the errant circuit breaker was a key disruptor on Jan. 27, the frequency of the halts point to another issue with the market: pervasively low liquidity as contracts near expiration. When a market is illiquid, virtually any activity can touch off outsized price moves. And when those swings are concentrated during the settlement window, they can move other markets in unpredictable ways. ""Natural gas futures are far more than a mere financial instrument,” said Adam Sinn, CEO of hedge fund Aspire Commodities. “They are a physical product that benchmark pricing for natural gas consumers, as well as setting the monthly electricity contract prices which determines Americans’ energy bills. The importance of the settlement being a legitimate process cannot be understated.” In any energy market, liquidity tends to decline heading into expiry as traders roll from one contract to the next. But traders say that, in gas, regulatory caps on the number of contracts a trader can hold are particularly hampering. Although the size of the market has ballooned, so-called position limits constrain participation because smaller traders often can’t meet the requirements. That gives large, well-capitalized speculators, like hedge funds, an outsized influence on market moves when liquidity dries up. The irony is that, while the position limits in CME are meant to guard against malfeasance, illiquidity can facilitate a type of manipulation called “banging the close,” in which a party concentrates a large volume of their trades during the settlement window to move the closing price in a particular direction. Aspire’s Sinn said this could be one explanation for gas’s moves on Jan. 27. “CFTC limits are arbitrarily reducing liquidity and that creates more volatility,” Perkins said. “To fix the liquidity issue we need to get rid of limits entirely or at least revise them."" At the same time, Intercontinental Exchange, called ICE, has become the platform of choice for physical US gas traders. The spread between prices on ICE and CME has widened – swelling last week to the biggest differential on record, according to traders. The widening spread would affect money managers and producers that use Nymex futures to hedge against price fluctuations, potentially resulting in losses, four traders said. Not a One-Off The market was already primed for chaos in the days leading up to Jan. 27, as forecasts abruptly shifted from milder-than-normal weather to a deep freeze across much of the country. That sent futures surging. As the cold knocked out gas production, prices rose even higher. That it all occurred as traders were rolling from the February contract to March only exacerbated the swings. It could all happen again, warned Perkins. Barring any changes to how the market operates, another cold snap could trigger a similar explosion at settlement. “A great deal of market participants have not seen price volatility like this since the 2014 winter and its extreme gyrations,” said Campbell Faulkner, senior vice president at brokerage BGC Group Inc. “All of this has combined to create an environment that has reminded people of the danger and difficulty of trading natural gas."" --With assistance from Devika Krishna Kumar, David Marino and Nicola M White.

Their list of tricky talking points just got a new addition — the so-called SaaSpocalypse.

It also spilled over to private-credit and alternative asset managers, many of whom were out in force at the event. However, evangelists of private markets pitching their products to Europe’s affluent had a different message: Nothing to see here. Meanwhile, investors fretted about the money managers’ exposure to those software companies. KKR & Co. ended the week almost 10% lower, while Ares Management Corp. dropped 12.8% even after the firms reported solid results. Both companies, together with peers Blackstone Inc., and EQT AB, are sitting on double-digit declines since the start of January. The jitters back home in London and New York pose a new challenge for private-market players who are already under scrutiny from regulators around the world. Policymakers in the US, European Union and Australia have been pushing for more transparency in private markets as they assess financial stability and contagion risks. While the stock plunge tests the ability of private-market advocates to pitch their funds to wealth clients and exposes their need to sharpen their marketing scripts, the tone at the IPEM conference — and outside — was broadly optimistic. Panelists including Ares’ head of investment strategy, Brendan McCurdy, discussed how to make alternatives a more central part of portfolios at the IPEM event on Feb. 5. At the same time, McCurdy’s boss and Ares Chief Executive Officer Michael Arougheti faced the task of addressing the company’s plunging share price as he unveiled results in New York. Markets are “missing the point” that loans are safe, Arougheti said in a Bloomberg Television interview Thursday. “That’s why I work in private markets, the markets trade on momentum, there’s a lot of forces in the public markets that are not tethered to fundamentals.” Story Continues The AI turbulence was front and center for KKR too, with the first analyst question on the company’s earnings call on Feb. 5 immediately addressing the “elephant in the room.” Co-Chief Executive Officer Scott Nuttall sought to assuage concerns, noting that only about 7% of its $744 billion of assets under management is exposed to software, a concentration well below industry levels. “We tell people here that they’ve got to focus on things they can control, short-term trading of our stock is not one of them,” KKR Chief Financial Officer Robert Lewin said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “We feel really good about our exposure. This isn’t something that has become front of mind in the past couple of days, this is something we have been thinking about for a number of years.” Won’t End Well Those reassurances aren’t likely to silence long-time critics who have been flagging the risks of opening private-market products to a broader and less sophisticated audience. The rush of money from everyday investors is “not going to end well,” 26north Partners founder and former Apollo co-founder Josh Harris said at a separate event this week. “People don’t understand the duration,” Harris said Tuesday at a Wall Street Journal conference. “They don’t understand that some of these structures may not be liquid when things go wrong — and that’s exactly when they need the money.” Such warnings and the latest market gyrations threaten to compound the pressure that’s gradually been building on the amped-up scores of private fund sales teams sipping champagne in the hotel bars along Cannes’ boulevard de la Croissette. More than 130 private market funds were launched over the past two years, after the European Commission overhauled rules for so-called Eltifs, short for European Long-Term Investment Fund. But asset managers have so far largely refrained from disclosing how much the vehicles have raised while they continue to work on building out their distribution channels. Growing pains are also being felt at relatively new private-markets players such as BlackRock Inc., which last year halted a plan to launch an infrastructure Eltif. Assets in open-ended vehicles, which offer investors the chance to withdraw some of their money — unless there’s a stampede for the exit — nearly quadrupled to €9 billion ($10.6 billion) in Europe from the beginning of 2024 through the end of September last year, according to Novantigo. The research and consulting firm estimates that Eltifs’ overall assets could reach more than €180 billion by the end of the decade, up from €29 billion currently. Europe’s fragmented regulatory landscape is a factor and has forced private fund giants including Blackstone, Apollo and KKR to go on a drive to educate intermediaries as they seek partners that can help sell their products to wealthy investors in countries across the continent. “Education is crucial to what we do,” said Farhad Karim, chief operating officer of Blackstone Private Wealth, speaking broadly of private markets. “When headlines move faster than fundamentals, the most important thing we can offer is transparency. When you do that, the picture often looks quite different from the narrative. Facts matter.” Private-market products haven’t yet taken off in Europe in marked contrast to the US, where adoption has been more widespread. For example, an Eltif doesn’t require a minimum investment, making it more accessible to retail investors. But many managers typically still ask fund buyers to stump up at least €10,000. Fees also tend to be far higher than what publicly traded funds charge, given the work involved in sourcing and executing deals. “This is a bit of a chicken and egg situation,” said Mara Dobrescu, a senior principal at research firm Morningstar Inc. Investment platforms have been slow in onboarding retail-oriented evergreen funds in Europe, citing operational complexity because these vehicles involve different notice periods, fee structures, redemption terms, and gating mechanisms, she said. At the same time, retail investors “haven’t exactly been clamoring” for these products either, she added. Structures like Eltifs are “fairly new and unfamiliar, and the lack of a track-record makes it difficult to know what to expect,” Dobrescu said. Race for Exit Market observers regularly warn that evergreen funds will have to restrict withdrawals when markets get choppy. That’s in part because individual investors can be more prone to a race for the exit at times of turbulence. The Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust is among the industry’s most recent and prominent examples. After a rapid rise in interest rates three years ago spooked investors who feared property values would fall, Blackstone was forced to limit withdrawals. Analysts and traders, meanwhile, are assessing the durability of private credit, a cornerstone of the products that private markets firms are racing to sell to wealth clients. A BlackRock private debt fund said last month that it expects to mark down the net value of its assets in part because of its exposure to e-commerce aggregators. Investors from one of Blue Owl Capital Inc.’s tech-focused funds pulled about 15.4% of net assets. IPEM’s organizers, for what it’s worth, seem to be acutely aware of the risks their industry is facing. In the event’s main brochure, the hosts liken private capital managers’ push into retail to a “gold rush” where “excitement is high” and competition fierce. “As the tide rises, we have a collective responsibility to remain disciplined and aligned to determine whether the industry stays on top — or is pulled under.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Cardholders Are Mad at Bilt’s CEO.

But both bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and gold ( GC=F ), the modern and traditional ""stores of value,"" had even wilder runs, falling around 20% and 7%, respectively. Both, like stocks, got some of their gains back. Those big numbers, especially for gold, highlight a truth investors are learning to reckon with: Stores of value just aren't what they used to be. Particularly for gold, a millennia-old store of wealth, which is seeing its classical role upended by volatility. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Subscribe In a sense, it's positive — if you own gold. Prices are up for the week, sitting at just under $5,000. They've risen about 14% so far this year. And there's a good chance we'll see it rise more. JPMorgan analysts, for instance, have doubled down on gold, forecasting demand from central banks and investors to push prices to $6,300 per ounce by the end of the year. That would mark a roughly 25% increase. Read more: Thinking of buying gold? Here's what investors should watch for. Geopolitical instability, the ""debasement"" of fiat currencies , and unresolved questions over debt loads have fueled gold's historic rise. A weakened insert-your-asset-of-choice has encouraged investors to cling to hard assets. Gains though they are, they reflect some wild, meme-stocky numbers that at least somewhat diminish gold's utility as a place to park value. Because, as we all know, what goes up that fast can also go down that fast. The crash earlier in the week punctuated what one expert described as a ""breathtaking and profoundly scary"" rise in precious metals . The price action created charts that looked like they belonged to stocks. Analysts could explain the moves behind the volatility , but some investors decided to just wait it out. Others, seizing the moment, both in the immediate sense and in our larger cultural shift toward casino-like amusements, bought the dip. An uncomfortable idea surrounding safe-haven assets is to think about the economic and political conditions required for their success. If you hold any crypto, though, you may not want to think too deeply about anything right now. Gold bars are displayed in a photo illustration, reflecting recent movements in gold prices driven by inflation concerns and central bank policy outlooks. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) · NurPhoto via Getty Images The comeback in stocks and gold's staggering climb make for a painful contrast . Bitcoin prices fell as low as $61,000 on Thursday. And even with a recovery on Friday to $70,000, the top digital currency is down about 44% from its October peak. Story Continues Crypto evangelists may have pitched bitcoin as 21st-century digital gold. But the new gold isn't bitcoin — it's just more volatile gold. Amid all this, the dollar , for all its movement, looks stable in comparison. If you're looking for stable value, there are probably places and moments to find it.

Learn more about money market account rates today.",https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/best-money-market-account-rates-today-saturday-february-7-2026-110017594.html,"Find out how much you could earn with today’s money market account rates . Deposit interest rates (including money market account rates) have been falling over the past two years. That's why it’s more important than ever to compare MMA rates and ensure you earn as much as possible on your balance. Overview of money market account rates today The national average money market account rate stands at 0.56%, according to the FDIC. This might not seem like much, but consider that four years ago, it was just 0.07%. So by historical standards, money market account rates are still quite high. Even so, some of the top accounts are currently offering over 4% APY. Since these rates may not be around much longer, consider opening a money market account now to take advantage of today’s high rates. Here’s a look at some of the top MMA rates available today: Additionally, the table below features some of the best savings and money market account rates available today from our verified partners. How much will $10,000 make in a money market account? The amount of interest you can earn from a money market account depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (money market account interest typically compounds daily). Say you put $10,000 in an MMA at the average interest rate of 0.56% with daily compounding. At the end of one year, your balance would grow to $10,056.16 — your initial $10,000 deposit, plus $56.16 in interest. Now let’s say you choose a high-yield money market account that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $10,408.08 over the same period, which includes $408.08 in interest. Frequently asked questions about money market account rates What is the downside of a money market account? Compared to a traditional savings account, a money market account may come with more restrictions. For example, money market accounts often require a higher minimum balance in order to earn the best interest rate and/or avoid fees. Certain MMAs may also limit the number of withdrawals you can make per month (typically six). Which bank gives 7% interest on savings accounts? In general, there are no banks that offer a 7% interest rate on money market accounts or any other type of deposit account. That said, you may be able to find local banks and credit unions running limited-time promotional rates on certain accounts, which could be as high as 7%. However, promotional rates at this level often apply to a limited balance. Read more: Do 7% interest savings accounts exist anymore?

Options pricing suggests traders expect the stock could reach new highs following the report. The Coca-Cola Company is set to post its fourth-quarter earnings ahead of the market open Tuesday, with traders anticipating the beverage giant's stock could extend its record-setting rally following the results. Current options pricing suggests traders see Coca-Cola ( KO ) stock moving up to 3% in either direction by the end of the week following the report. A move of that size from Friday's record-high close at $79 could lift the stock above $81, or bring it back down to about $76. The shares have gained 13% since the start of the year, amid a broader rotation into consumer staples stocks . Rival PepsiCo ( PEP ), which on Tuesday reported better-than-expected earnings, has also seen its stock surge in recent weeks. Why This Matters to Investors Widely regarded as a bellwether for the consumer staples sector, analysts and investors will likely be watching what Coca-Cola's results could say about the state of U.S. consumers, and how America's food and beverage giants are navigating shifting tastes. Since last reporting results in October , Coca-Cola has announced plans to transition to a new CEO, with company veteran COO Henrique Braun set to succeed James Quincey's nine-year tenure starting on March 31. The company's revenue is expected to come in at roughly $12 billion for the fourth quarter, up 4% year-over-year, while adjusted earnings per share are projected to rise by 2 cents to $0.57, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Ahead of the report, UBS analysts said they expect a solid quarter from Coca-Cola and that the biggest hurdle to the stock rising could be a high valuation compared to its peers. The analysts said it's possible investors may look to other consumer staples stocks for higher growth potential. Of the seven analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha, six have recommended buying Coca-Cola's stock, compared to one neutral rating. Their average price target is just above $81, suggesting slim upside to Friday's record close. Read the original article on Investopedia View Comments"

The rally followed days of sharp swings that had unsettled investors, including heavy losses for software stocks and a blistering selloff in bitcoin BTCUSD, raising fresh questions about whether the bull market’s momentum was starting to unravel.

Do I push it and risk ruining our relationship? I’m 59, earning six figures, but my daughter wants me to retire to watch my future grandkid for a year. Can I afford it? It has been just 431 trading days since the Dow last crossed a 10,000-point threshold, when it first finished above 40,000 on May 17, 2024, according to Dow Jones Market Data — the fastest climb between such milestones on record. DOW JONES MARKET DATA - The Dow DJIA surged 1,206.95 points, or 2.5%, to finish at 50,115.67 on Friday, scoring a fresh record close, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Friday’s rally marked the index’s biggest percentage gain since May of last year. Earlier in the week, investors were rattled by a selloff in software companies — sparked in part by fallout tied to artificial-intelligence firm Anthropic’s new offerings — alongside bitcoin’s plunge, amplifying fears that risk tolerance was giving way. By Friday, however, investors rotated back into established bellwethers rather than retreating from stocks altogether. Gains for Nvidia NVDA, Caterpillar CAT, 3M MMM, Amgen AMGN and Goldman Sachs GS helped propel the Dow higher, signaling renewed confidence in blue-chip names even as volatility lingered elsewhere. The Dow crossing 50,000 points is likely to capture the attention of individual investors who don’t follow markets daily, though strategists caution that broader measures such as the S&P 500 SPX provide a more complete view of U.S. equities. Still, the milestone — arriving after a week that tested confidence — may reinforce expectations that the bull market has further room to run. The new milestone for the Dow could spur some individual investors to chase the rally, said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, in a phone interview. Story Continues For his part, Wren expects the U.S. stock market will continue to rise this year on the back of an accelerating economy. He ntoed that Wells Fargo Investment Institute earlier this week raised its forecast for growth this year in real gross domestic product in the U.S. by half of a percentage point, to 2.9%. The Dow’s big day on Friday also caught the attention of President Donald Trump. “The Dow Jones Industrial Average just hit 50,000 for the first time in History. CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA!,” Trump wrote in a social-media post on Friday afternoon . The U.S. stock market rebounded sharply ahead of the weekend, with all three major benchmarks bouncing from Thursday’s selloff. The Dow notched its fifth record closing high of 2026, while the S&P 500 ended 2% higher Friday and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP rose 2.2%. Still, a brutal week marked by the selloff in tech stocks over the previous three days left the S&P 500 and Nasdaq with weekly losses. That’s in contrast to the Dow, which advanced 2.5% on the week. The Dow’s top performer Friday, artificial-intelligence-chip maker Nvidia, gained almost 8% to book its best day since April 9, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Despite that large rebound, Nvidia’s shares had a weekly loss of 3%, reflecting the tech sector’s tumultuous week. Most Read from MarketWatch Dow 50,000 came as the market looked set to crack.

2026-02-08 09:30:36,Why Amazon (AMZN) Stock Is Down Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-amazon-amzn-stock-down-211135555.html,"In this article: AMZN What Happened? Shares of cloud computing and online retail behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 7.2% in the afternoon session after the company announced a massive $200 billion capital spending plan for 2026 and reported mixed fourth-quarter results. The forecast, a more than 50% increase in capital expenditures compared to 2025, spooked investors who were concerned about its impact on near-term profitability and free cash flow. While Amazon's revenue beat expectations and its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment showed strength, this was overshadowed by an operating profit miss. Adding to the negative sentiment, the company's operating profit guidance for the upcoming quarter also fell short of analysts' forecasts. The shares closed the day at $209.79, down 6% from previous close. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Amazon? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free . What Is The Market Telling Us Amazon’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 6 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock dropped 4.5% on the news that German regulators ordered the company to stop imposing price controls on its marketplace in the country and to hand over approximately $70 million in alleged unfair gains. Germany's Federal Cartel Office prohibited Amazon from setting price caps for third-party retailers, stating the company's methods were ""based on non-transparent rules."" The watchdog added that it was not clear to sellers how these price limits were determined. This negative regulatory news arrived as the company was scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results, adding to investor unease. Concerns were already present regarding Amazon's rising capital expenditures, which surged in 2025, largely driven by investments in data centers and AI infrastructure. Amazon is down 7.4% since the beginning of the year, and at $209.83 per share, it is trading 17.4% below its 52-week high of $254 from November 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Amazon’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,263.

2026-02-08 09:30:38,"Stocks hit historic milestone as Dow crosses 50,000 points for first time ever",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-hit-historic-milestone-dow-192408370.html,"In this article: ^IXIC The Dow soared more than 1,200 points Friday and hit an all-time high. - Richard Drew/AP The Dow just hit 50,000 points for the first time ever. The blue-chip index on Friday surged 1,207 points, or 2.47%, and closed at 50,115.67. It’s the first time the 129-year-old index has crossed the historic 50,000-point milestone. The Dow’s ascent is emblematic of the stock market’s persistent rise despite recent tumultuous geopolitical events . Stocks in the United States — and across the globe — have climbed higher this year despite uncertainty about turmoil in Iran, tensions between Washington and Brussels over Greenland and the US’ capture of Nicholas Maduro . Stock market investors are also assessing the health of the artificial intelligence boom and digesting President Donald Trump’s pick of Kevin Warsh to chair the Federal Reserve. Wall Street rallied sharply Friday, rebounding after a three-day rout in technology and software stocks. The broader S&P 500 rose 1.97%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 2.18%. The Dow and S&P each had their best day since May, while the Nasdaq had its best day since November. Rally broadens out The US stock market is in the fourth year of a bull market. The Dow has pushed higher as the rally has broadened out, with investors scooping up more than just high-flying tech stocks. The blue-chip index is outpacing the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 this year as investors rotate into sectors like industrials and financials. The Dow is more focused on sectors like financials and industrials, and less exposed to the tech sector, which accounts for a larger share of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite’s market value. Goldman Sachs ( GS ) and Caterpillar ( CAT ), the two stocks with the most influence over the price-weighted Dow, rose 4.31% and 7.06% Friday, respectively. Caterpillar hit a record high. “The positives of the Dow getting to that new milestone, is it’s showing we’re seeing a broadening in the market,” said Matt Dmytryszyn, chief investment officer at Composition Wealth. “It’s not just tech stocks and AI. We’re seeing more broader financial and industrial and healthcare companies starting to become more broadly bought and recognized in the market.” Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange on January 9, 2026. - Seth Wenig/AP The Dow hitting 50,000 for the first time reflects Wall Street’s optimism about the US economy and is just another record now broken on the market’s multi-year bull run. CNN’s Fear and Greed Index shifted from “fear” into “neutral” Friday. “Fundamentals remain solidly in place, meaning improving earnings growth and resilient consumer spending,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management. On paper, the economy is doing fine. Wall Street is hopeful for interest rate cuts from the Fed later this year. Continua a leggere Underneath the hood, however, the picture is less rosy. Consumer spending is being driven by wealthier households who tend have money in stocks and have seen their investments rise in value, while people who rely on paychecks for their income are feeling strained by a lack of affordability. Meanwhile, some on Wall Street continue to warn of complacency in financial markets amid affronts to the Fed’s independence, persistent nerves about a bubble and increasingly fraught geopolitics. “The US economy has remained resilient,” Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement on January 13 as the bank reported fourth-quarter earnings results. “Consumers continue to spend, and businesses generally remain healthy,” Dimon said. “However, as usual, we remain vigilant, and markets seem to underappreciate the potential hazards — including from complex geopolitical conditions, the risk of sticky inflation and elevated asset prices.” Long road to 50,000 The Dow was established in 1896 by journalists Charles Dow and Edward Jones. The index initially covered 12 industrial stocks, including General Electric, National Lead and the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. The Dow is older than the S&P 500, which was established in 1957 (though precursors had existed since 1928) and the Nasdaq Composite, which was established in 1971. The Dow in 1928 expanded from 12 stocks to 30 stocks — and the Dow has remained a 30-stock index since. Different companies have rotated in and out of the Dow overtime, reflecting the changing and developing American economy. unknown content item - The Dow officially closed above 1,000 points for the first time on November 14, 1972. Here’s a look back at other significant milestones on the road to 50,000: Dow 10,000: March 29, 1999. Dow 15,000 : May 7, 2013. Dow 20,000: January 25, 2017. Dow 30,000 : Nov. 24, 2020. The Dow clinched 40,000 points in May 2024 before hitting 45,000 on December 4 of that year. As President Donald Trump’s announcement of his widespread tariff regime rocked global markets in April 2025, the index briefly tumbled below 37,000 points — down roughly 18% from its peak above 45,000 in December 2024. But the Dow rebounded as Trump walked back his most severe tariff proposals. The blue-chip index reclaimed 45,000 in August 2025 before eclipsing 46,000 , 47,000 and 48,000 in quick succession across the following months. The Dow pushed above 49,000 for the first time ever on January 6 before surpassing 50,000 on Friday. “50k is an incredible milestone, especially considering we are getting close in a couple of months to the anniversary of the tariff tantrum period where the Dow traded into the 36,000s, so it has been quite the recovery and trend,” said Ken Mahoney, president and CEO at Mahoney Asset Management. The Dow has experienced various bull and bear markets, from the roaring 1920s to the Great Depression, the exuberance of the dot-com bubble in the 1990s to crash of the early 2000s, and the slides and rebounds of the financial crisis of 2008 and the Covid-19 pandemic in the early 2020s. The Dow is only 30 companies and is price-weighted. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq track hundreds of companies and are market value-weighted. The Dow’s history is what makes the index unique, according to Dmytryszyn at Composition Wealth. “I grew up listening to the TV and radio, and you hear what the Dow is doing,” he said. “It just has some of that historical context in it, that tradition to it.” What Dow 50k means for you 50,000 is just another round number for the stock index. But the milestone signifies a strong start to 2026. The S&P 500, which covers a broader range of companies, hit a record high in late January. Retirement plans like 401(k)s are often invested in funds that track benchmark US stock indexes like the S&P 500 or the Dow. As the market climbs higher, Americans’ retirement savings might look a little more plush than usual. Doug Beath, global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he thinks investors will continue to look through “the noise of negative headlines” and instead “focus on positive forces we see propelling growth through 2026: tax cuts, deregulation and falling short-term interest rates.” Still, Beath said he would not be surprised if markets hit patches of volatility as companies continue to report fourth-quarter earnings and “the threat of escalating geopolitical tensions remains.” “We will treat pullbacks as opportunities to rebalance funds toward favored sectors that benefit from the ancillary trends related to AI with more attractive valuations: financials, utilities and industrials,” Beath said. The New York Stock Exchange in New York, on Friday, January 2, 2026. - Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty Images Meanwhile, as stocks continue a bull run that has eclipsed dozens of record highs, some investors are also cautioning that there might not be as much room for US stocks to run this year . International stocks outperformed US stocks in 2025 for the first time in years, and are ahead of US markets so far this year. Record highs in the stock market are an opportunity to review your savings portfolio and ensure it is well-diversified to match your risk tolerance and your life goals. “Stocks are well-positioned for further gains this year, but with valuations already reflecting optimistic estimates of AI-driven productivity growth and cost savings, the market may have set a fairly high bar for itself,” Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley’s wealth management market research and strategy team, said in a note.

2026-02-08 09:30:40,"Dow soars by 1,200 points as Wall Street rebounds from tech meltdown",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-why-tech-stocks-103046857.html,"In this article: ^IXIC ^GSPC Wall Street rallied sharply Friday, rebounding from a tech rout earlier this week. - Brendan McDermid/Reuters The sell-off in tech stocks screeched to a halt Friday as investors stepped in to buy the dip: The Dow soared 1,207 points, or 2.47%, and hit 50,000 points for the first time ever. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 2.18% and the S&P 500 rose 1.97%. The Dow and S&P each posted their best day since May. The Nasdaq had its best day since November. Tech stocks had dragged down Wall Street earlier this week as investors fled once-hot shares, and Friday’s fierce rally comes after the Nasdaq’s worst three-day slide since April. The index had shed more than $1.5 trillion in market value this week before rebounding Friday. It’s been a turbulent few days for Wall Street, Big Tech and the entire software industry. Here’s why: Nerves about AI tools disrupting business models are hurting software stocks. Investors are becoming skeptical about Big Tech’s massive spending spree on building data centers to power the AI boom. Tech stocks were already expensive from big gains in recent years, making them susceptible to a “shoot first and ask questions later” sell-off. The AI tide lifted all boats for a while; now, Wall Street has to get picky about winners and losers. “Recent months have seen a shift from the ‘every tech stock is a winner’ mindset to a more brutal landscape of winners and losers,” Jim Reid, head of global macro research at Deutsche Bank, said in a Thursday note. A sell-off in risky assets like bitcoin — which just hit its lowest level since October 2024 — also probably fueled investors’ desire for safer assets earlier this week. Bitcoin rebounded Friday, soaring 10% to roughly $70,000. “Stocks are off to a volatile start in February,” Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth, said in a note. “The bull market is not dead, but it is aging, and we are not surprised to see investors paying more attention to corporate earnings and profitability,” Bellin said. Software shares slumped on AI nerves AI startup Anthropic on Friday released new tools that the company says can do more tasks for the legal industry. That made Wall Street nervous that companies will soon be able to dump their existing, specialized subscriptions to data analytics and research software, directly hurting software companies’ bottom lines. The jury is still out on whether that will actually happen. But investors were spooked and dumped shares in legal and financial software and services companies. There have been nerves about AI eating into software’s market share for a while: Salesforce ( CRM ), a software company in the blue-chip Dow index, slumped 20% in 2025 and is down 28% so far this year. Story Continues Big tech keeps spending Meanwhile, Wall Street is in the midst of corporate earnings season. There are lingering concerns (remember nerves about an AI bubble? ) about Big Tech’s aspirations to build out massive data centers and infrastructure to power the AI boom and uncertainty about just how profitable that building rush will prove. Microsoft ( MSFT ), Alphabet ( GOOG ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) all outlined plans across the past week to increase their spending on building data centers and infrastructure. Wall Street wants to see evidence that these enormous expenditures will result in actual profits. Microsoft shares dropped 10% on January 29 after the company reported earnings. Amazon shares fell roughly 5.6% Friday after the company’s reported earnings Thursday afternoon. “The bar for Big Tech remains extremely high,” Seana Smith, senior investment strategist at Global X ETFs, told CNN. “Markets are only rewarding AI investment when it is paired with clear, durable revenue growth,” Smith said. Tech was vulnerable to a sell-off The AI theme has driven the stock market higher across the past three years. Some investors are balking at paying those high prices and are instead looking for off-ramps. Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) on Wednesday sank 17% and had their worst day since 2017 after the company forecast slightly less revenue in the first quarter than analysts had expected. AMD shares rebounded 8% on Friday. Valuations, a measure of how pricey stocks are, have been elevated for some tech companies. Palantir ( PLTR ), a star of the AI trade, surged 340% in 2024 and 135% in 2025. Palantir is now down 35% from its record high in early November. Oracle shares ( ORCL ) hit a record high on September 10 after the company announced a $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Oracle shares have tanked 59% since then. “Crowded trades are difficult to exit,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said in a note. “Assets that have been granted premium valuations, whether through rational expectations or speculative fervor, are more prone to messy selloffs if perceptions and/or momentum change.” Winners and losers In recent years, anything related to AI has been a hot trade on Wall Street. But now investors need to get picky about specific companies they think will benefit. “Consensus about software companies has flipped to them being AI victims, not beneficiaries,” Sosnick at Interactive Brokers told CNN. “The rising tide surrounding AI was lifting a lot of boats,” Sosnick said. “Now it’s forcing Wall Street to be much more selective and really decide who are the winners and losers. And that’s going to require a lot more detailed analysis, rather than just sort of riding the momentum train.” Was the sell-off overdone? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said this week the idea that software will be replaced by AI was “illogical,” according to Reuters . Barclays backs up that sentiment. “It just does not seem realistic” that AI companies can supplant those industry-specific software tools, wrote Nick Dempsey, direct of media equity research at Barclays, in a note. But with markets this touchy, headlines about the possibility are “clearly not helpful,” he added. An exchange-traded fund tracking the software industry rose roughly 3% on Friday, pausing an eight-day slide. “At this point, the negativity surrounding AI-related tech is getting pretty intense,” Tom Essaye, president of Sevens Report Research, said in a note. “Granted, there are reasons for the skepticism, but the declines in some of these stocks are substantial, and if AI is more resilient than expected (which has been the case in each test so far over the past three years), then there are opportunities [for buying] developing,” Essaye said. Separately, chipmakers also gained Friday as Big Tech’s plans for data centers will likely boost demand for semiconductor chips. Nvidia shares ( NVDA ) soared 7.78% and had their best day since April. “When you pull the beach ball underwater that quickly in places like Big Tech, certainly software and semis, the bounce back can be breathtaking,” Chris Galipeau, senior market strategist at Franklin Templeton, told CNN.

2026-02-08 09:30:42,This little-noticed bond-market development could put many borrowers on edge,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/little-noticed-bond-market-development-210100996.html,"Developments in the Treasury market this year could blunt the impact that another Federal Reserve interest-rate cut might have on borrowers. - MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto Big moves in stocks and cryptocurrencies have commanded the lion’s share of investors’ attention this week. But things are also unfolding in the bond market that could have major implications for borrowers this year. A trading pattern known as a steepening of the Treasury yield curve gained momentum this week. If this dynamic remains in place by the time the Federal Reserve is ready to cut interest rates this year — or when traders solidify their expectations on the timing of such a move — it will likely be harder for consumers and businesses borrowing over a long-term horizon to enjoy the full benefits of lower short-term borrowing costs. Most Read from MarketWatch I settled my father’s estate, but found a will deeding a mobile home to his stepson. Am I ethically and legally obliged to fix this? The Social Security data breach is a national-security disaster that could hurt Americans for the rest of their lives: whistleblower My brother refuses to sell our family’s $150K lake house, yet I pay all the bills. Do I push it and risk ruining our relationship? I’m 59, earning six figures, but my daughter wants me to retire to watch my future grandkid for a year. Can I afford it? On Thursday, signs of a weakening U.S. labor market caused traders to boost their expectations for a Fed rate cut as soon as March and to price in a slightly greater chance of a total of three or more reductions by year-end. The policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y fell at a faster pace than the rate on the 10-year note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y as a result. That pushed the spread between the yields on the two notes to one of its widest levels in four years, at 72.8 basis points. The spread between 2- and 10-year Treasurys touched one of its widest levels in four years on Thursday. - Generally speaking, a steepening curve is often associated with a brighter U.S. economic outlook and an environment in which banks are encouraged to lend more freely because they can also borrow more cheaply. This time around, though, something a bit different is going on. Yield curves are steepening around the world — including in Japan, Germany, the U.K. and Canada — because of a sense that “governments are adding to fiscal stimulus and concerns are growing around the sustainability of that,” according to Tom Nakamura, head of fixed income and currencies at AGF Investments in Toronto. In the U.S., the Treasury curve has more room to steepen relative to bond markets in other countries for a number of reasons, Nakamura said in a phone interview on Friday. Those reasons include worries about an “overreaching” White House that may interfere with the Fed’s independence and push for lower interest rates, which could then result in inflationary pressures and investors demanding more compensation for the risk of holding long-term Treasurys, he said. Story continues A Treasury curve that remains steeper around the same time the Fed is ready, or expected, to cut rates translates into a more difficult time for consumers or businesses looking for mortgages or long-term loans. Under that scenario, loans priced off of 10- and 30-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD30Y would not be moving down in lockstep with the Fed’s rate move. Officials at the central bank kept rates unchanged in January and have indicated that only one rate cut is likely to be appropriate for this year. Meanwhile, the central bank has purchased more than $90 billion of Treasury bills since December, which some say is helping to stabilize long-term borrowing costs. A steeper curve “makes it harder to get by on those things that matter to consumers,” Nakamura said. “Even if the Fed lowers policy rates to stimulate the economy, borrowers may not get as much benefit from this on new mortgages or even with auto financing, which covers two- to five-year periods.” Meanwhile, companies looking to finance over a 10-year period or more would find the cost of doing so to be more expensive, he added. On Friday, financial markets recovered from what has been a bruising week stemming from jitters over artificial-intelligence spending, along with tumult in bitcoin and metals. All three major U.S. stock indexes DJIA SPX COMP closed sharply higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossing the 50,000 mark for the first time, and short-term U.S. government debt sold off slightly as investors embraced riskier assets. The 2-year yield finished up by 1.2 basis points at 3.49%, while the 10-year rate remained near 4.21%. The spread between the two shrank to 71.2 basis points on Friday, a touch narrower than in the previous session. Debt concerns “are not going away” and, if they persist, may leave the Treasury market “biased toward a steeper curve,” Nakamura said. But if the labor market falters in a way that raises expectations for weaker economic growth and softer inflation, this could flatten the curve around the time the Fed starts cutting rates. A flatter curve, he said, also has the potential to “offset fiscal concerns.” Most Read from MarketWatch Dow 50,000 came as the market looked set to crack.

Neither Warsh nor Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has detailed what they may consider after the former Fed governor takes the helm. The nominee did say in a CNBC interview last year that an agreement could “describe plainly and with deliberation” what the Fed’s balance-sheet size would be, with the Treasury laying out its debt-issuance plans. Photographer: Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg A revamp could prove to be just a bureaucratic tweak, with little near-term impact for the $30 trillion Treasuries market. But a more ambitious effort involving a shake-up of the Fed’s current, $6 trillion-plus securities portfolio could see increased volatility and — depending on the scenario — deepening concern over the US central bank’s independence. Looming over any Fed-Treasury talks would be Trump, who last year argued that one of the central bank’s duties in setting interest rates is to mind the government’s debt costs. Those are currently running at an annual clip of around $1 trillion, or half the budget deficit. “Rather than insulating the Fed, it could look more like a framework for yield-curve control,” Tim Duy, chief US economist at SGH Macro Advisors, said of an accord. “A public agreement that synchronizes the Fed’s balance sheet with Treasury financing explicitly ties monetary operations to deficits.” And that was exactly what the 1951 agreement brought to an end. The Fed had capped both short- and longer-dated Treasury yields during World War II and its aftermath to hold down federal borrowing costs. That recipe caused postwar inflation to soar, however. The Truman administration — in a watershed moment that crystallized the Fed’s autonomy over monetary policy — then agreed to let policymakers set rates on their own. Story Continues Warsh last April said the Fed had effectively violated the 1951 principles with its massive waves of bond purchases, after the financial crisis and the pandemic. In interviews and speeches, he’s argued that these actions encouraged reckless government borrowing. Warsh, contacted through the Hoover Institution where he has served as a fellow, didn’t respond to a request for comment on a potential Fed-Treasury accord. The Treasury also didn’t respond. Skinny Version Bessent has similarly blasted the central bank for sticking with such quantitative easing for too long, saying it even damaged the market’s ability to give off important financial signals. The Treasury chief, who oversaw the vetting process to choose a successor to Jerome Powell, has argued for Fed QE “in true emergencies and in coordination with the rest of government.” So a new accord could simply spell out that — outside of day-to-day liquidity management — the Fed would only make large-scale Treasuries purchases with the Treasury’s endorsement, with an eye to halting the QE as soon as market conditions allowed. But inserting the Treasury into Fed decisions in such a way could prompt other interpretations. Krishna Guha at Evercore ISI said, “investors will read this as implying that Bessent will have a soft veto” on any quantitative tightening plans. A meatier version of an accord would lay out what many market participants expect: A rollover of Fed Treasuries holdings from mid- and longer-tenor securities to bills, which mature in 12 months or less. That would then allow the Treasury to scale back sales of notes and bonds, or not boost them as much as otherwise. In its quarterly statement on debt management on Wednesday, the department drew a link between Fed actions and its issuance plans — saying it was keeping an eye on a recent step-up in purchases of bills by the central bank. “We’re already heading down that path” of closer Fed-Treasury coordination, said Jack McIntyre of Brandywine Global. “The question is whether it gets magnified.” The risk: Investors view the Fed’s actions as moving it away from its inflation-fighting mandate, increasing prospects for higher volatility and inflation expectations. A worst-case scenario might see an undermining of the appeal of the US dollar and safe haven status of Treasuries. If there’s an accord that “implies that the Treasury can count on the Fed buying some portion of the debt or on some portion of the curve for the foreseeable future, that’s hugely, hugely problematic,” said Ed Al-Hussainy, a portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Some Doubts Warsh, who could take the helm in May if he’s confirmed ahead of the expiration of Powell’s term as chair, may seek to avoid any such outcome. “Warsh will be committed to keeping the Fed separate,” said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at RBC BlueBay Asset Management. “That does not rule out greater collaboration, but it makes a formal accord less likely.” Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg Others have laid out expansive scenarios where the Fed is one part of a multi-step initiative to revamp federal authorities’ imprint in the bond market. Guha, Evercore ISI’s head of central bank strategy, has floated the idea of the Fed swapping its $2 trillion mortgage bond portfolio with the Treasury Department, in exchange for bills. While that poses several hurdles and may ultimately prove unlikely, one goal could be to lower mortgage rates — a key focus of the Trump administration. The president last month directed government-controlled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities to help cap borrowing costs for prospective homebuyers. A new accord could “provide, over time, a framework for the Fed working in tandem with the Treasury – and perhaps also with the housing agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – to shrink the size of its balance sheet,” wrote Richard Clarida, a global economic adviser at Pacific Investment Management Co and former Fed vice chair. Portfolio Shift Warsh would almost certainly be unable to do a deal with Bessent on his own. But some current Fed policymakers have backed the idea of shifting the central bank’s portfolio to bills and argued that its heavy exposure to long-term assets no longer reflects market structure. Deutsche Bank strategists predicted that a Warsh-led Fed would likely be an active buyer of Treasury bills for the coming five to seven years. In one scenario, they see T-bills rising to as much as 55% of its holdings, from less than 5% now. A commensurate shift by the Treasury to sell bills rather than interest-bearing securities wouldn’t be cost-free, however. With a giant amount of debt constantly rolling over, it would increase the volatility of the Treasury’s borrowing costs. What Bloomberg strategists say... “In a Warsh–Bessent world, the reduction of the Fed’s balance sheet could be mapped to a predictable Treasury debt plan to give markets clarity on liquidity and supply. If Treasury issuance and Fed’s balance sheet path is steady and credibly telegraphed over the long term, accidental tightening of financial conditions can be avoided and any unforced shocks in rates markets would be limited.” — Michael Ball, Macro Strategist, Markets Live. For the full analysis, click here. With or without an accord, market participants are on watch for a tighter relationship between the Fed and Treasury when it comes to the bond market. And while the aim might be to limit the interest costs to all types of American borrowers, any fundamental shift has its dangers. Outright coordination to damp interest costs “might work for a while,” said George Hall, an economics professor at Brandeis University and a former Chicago Fed researcher. But in the long-run, investors have alternatives to US assets. “People will figure out ways around that, and over time will take their money elsewhere,” he said. --With assistance from Alexandra Harris, Ruth Carson, Elizabeth Stanton and Daniel Flatley.

Wall Street strategists say the move may be overdone.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-probably-seems-overdone-wall-street-strategists-weigh-in-on-software-stock-sell-off-160003877.html,"In this article: ANTH.PVT GOOG IVZ ^IXIC CRM A Friday bounce may have left some investors feeling better heading into the weekend, but a violent sell-off in tech names focused on the software industry this past week had Wall Street strategists trying to steady clients' nerves across the investment world. Software names were crushed on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday last week as investors priced in even more aggressive disruptions to these businesses amid AI advances, with the uptake of Anthropic’s Claude Code the latest source of angst . And despite a rebound on Friday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted a weekly decline of more than 2%, with software giants Salesforce ( CRM ) and ServiceNow ( NOW ) shares falling more than 9%, among a host of other names in the space that also dropped. Still, the magnitude of the selling had several strategists urging patience and suggesting these moves may have actually overshot the potential risks facing these industries. ""You're getting to a point where this probably seems overdone,"" Invesco chief global market strategist Brian Levitt told Yahoo Finance last week. ""We've seen some names taken out pretty significantly."" ""Clearly, there's concern about what some artificial intelligence programs are going to mean for different software businesses, but we've seen some names taken out pretty significantly,"" he added. Strategists believe the disruption won't be severe across all companies. ""Larger software companies that are positioned to adapt, [they're] going to be fine,"" said JonesTrading chief market strategist Mike O'Rourke. ""The problem is there are new risks out there."" O’Rourke said productivity commentary during Alphabet’s earnings call only reinforced “the alarm” the market has sounded about AI agents. Software stocks year-to-date. Earnings from Big Tech giants over the last week also revealed the sheer amount of capital being poured into AI, as capital expenditures from Amazon ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ), Meta ( META ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) are set to top $650 billion . ""Investors are now kind of being more discerning,"" Dave Mazza, CEO of Roundhill Investors, told Yahoo Finance on Friday . “People are really pulling back before they begin to say, 'How much do I want to value a company even if it's growing,' knowing that they’re moving from a capital-light industry to maybe a more capital-intensive industry?” he added. Mazza mentioned that there are still areas of the market that remain undervalued, such as Consumer Staples ( XLP ) and Energy ( XLE ). Notably, cyclical and defensive sectors have also outperformed tech ( XLK ), which is negative for the year. Story Continues ""What we've been telling people even coming into the year is like, look, let's start to diversify away from some of this AI trade and, you know, what we watch [are] leading indicators of the economy,"" Invesco's Levitt said.

The S&P 500 Index has already breached its short-term trigger that prompted Commodity Trading Advisers, or CTAs, to sell stocks. Goldman expects these systematic strategies — which follow the stock market direction rather than fundamental factors — to remain net sellers over the coming week, regardless of market direction. Most Read from Bloomberg Canadian Province New Brunswick to Quit Using Elon Musk’s X For These Old Bus Stations, It’s Not the End of the Line Milan Olympics Housing Is Built for Easy Reuse NYC Mayor Mamdani Backs Governor Hochul’s Reelection Bid A renewed decline could trigger about $33 billion of selling this week, according to Goldman. If pressure continues and the S&P 500 falls below 6,707, it could unlock up to $80 billion of additional systematic selling over the next month, the bank’s data show. In a flat market, CTAs are projected to unload roughly $15.4 billion of US equities this week, and even if stocks rise, the funds are expected to shed about $8.7 billion. Investor stress was running high last week. The firm’s Panic Index — which combines one-month S&P implied volatility, VIX volatility, S&P one-month put-call skew and the slope of the S&P volatility term structure — most recently stood at 9.22, a level indicating markets are not far from “max fear” on Thursday. The S&P 500 surged 2% on Friday, ending a volatile week with its biggest gain since May. The rally followed a sharp early-week drop in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, triggered by the launch of a new AI automation tool from Anthropic PBC that wiped billions of dollars off software, financial services and asset-management stocks as investors reassessed disruption risks. Positioning across the so-called systematic strategies was the most common question among Goldman’s clients Friday, underscoring the demand for a view of financial flows. On top of the CTA selling, thin liquidity and ‘short gamma’ positioning will keep the market choppy, potentially magnifying swings in either direction as dealers buy into rallies and sell into drawdowns to balance their positions. S&P top-of-book liquidity — the volume of buy and sell orders available at the best bid and lowest ask price — has deteriorated sharply, falling to about $4.1 million from a year-to-date average near $13.7 million. “The inability to transfer risk quickly lends itself to a choppier intraday tape and delays stabilization in overall price action,” Goldman’s trading desk team including Gail Hafif and Lee Coppersmith wrote in a note to clients Friday. Story continues Option dealer positioning has also flipped in a way that may exacerbate moves. After sitting in an area of so-called long gamma that helped prevent a break above the 7,000 level, dealers are now estimated to be flat to short gamma. The dynamic that becomes more pronounced when liquidity is scarce. “Buckle up,” the traders added. Other systematic cohorts retain meaningful room to de-risk. Risk-parity positioning sits in the 81st percentile, looking back over a year, while volatility-control strategies are in the 71st percentile. Unlike CTAs, these funds respond to sustained changes in realized volatility, suggesting their impact would be more pronounced if volatility remains elevated. S&P 500 realized volatility is on the rise, but the 20-day gauge is sill below levels seen in November and December. Seasonality offers little relief. February has historically been a weaker and choppier month for both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 as supportive January flows — including retirement contributions and peak retail activity — fade. Retail behavior is also showing signs of fatigue. After a year of relentless dip-buying, the latest two-day net retail imbalance showed roughly $690 million of selling last week, demonstrating less willingness to “buy all dips.” Popular retail trades tied to crypto and crypto-linked equities have been hit particularly hard, raising the risk that any broader rotation out of US stocks would mark a notable shift from last year’s trading patterns.

A slew of data releases this past week suggested that at the start of 2026, the job market remained stuck in a stubbornly frozen state at best — and flashed further signs of splintering at worst. January’s layoff plans were the worst for the month since 2009 , while private employers added just 22,000 jobs , compared to the gain of 140,000 jobs during the same period a year ago. Beyond the data points, recent weeks brought broad layoff announcements from Amazon, Pinterest, UPS, Home Depot, the Washington Post, and others. And the sector that dominated job growth last year — healthcare and social services — also appears to be slowing down with postings, according to Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. Sign up for the Mind Your Money weekly newsletter By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Subscribe “We can’t necessarily stay frozen like this for long. Either things are going to fall into a deeper freeze, or they’re going to have to start to thaw,” Stahle said. “If we look at the direction that all of the economic indicators are going, there’s definite, clear momentum for things freezing deeper, or things getting worse.” 2025 warning signs? To be sure, the belle of the labor market data ball — the monthly jobs report — has yet to appear. January’s unemployment rate and payroll growth statistics won’t be out until Wednesday morning after a brief delay caused by the partial government shutdown. Do you have a story about navigating the job market? Reach out to Emma Ockerman here. Economists expect payroll growth of 70,000, and the Chicago Fed estimates the unemployment rate declined slightly. The report will also include standard revisions to the Labor Department’s 2025 data, which are expected to show the economy added fewer jobs than initially reported. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has even suggested that payroll growth might have been negative by 20,000 jobs on a monthly basis since April. The government’s final report on job openings for 2025 offered other signs of troubled waters: The economy logged 6.5 million jobs open at the end of December, far short of economists' expectations and the lowest level since 2020. Even though more recent data on openings from hiring site Indeed suggests the situation didn’t get much worse in January, it’s nonetheless concerning that it hasn’t improved much either. Read more: Worried about job security? Here's how to protect your finances. Meanwhile, the number of people filing initial claims for unemployment insurance increased more than expected in the last week of January, hitting 231,000 in a swing that was likely influenced by severe winter weather, as initial claims have otherwise been relatively low. Story Continues There’s some reason to believe that initial claims should be higher, said Michele Evermore, senior fellow at the National Academy of Social Insurance. In Minnesota, for example, claims dropped for much of January until slightly increasing last week, Evermore said. That’s in a state where recipients are typically better able to access benefits. In states where it’s more difficult to apply, however, some eligible applicants may be shrugging off the perk because it’s too onerous or too small. “We’re not getting a clear picture of the actual jobs market from the initial and continued claims because we’ve cut unemployment insurance to the point where it doesn’t matter anymore in some ways,” Evermore said. A good economy for some, but not for all Still, other data paints a picture of an economy that’s chugging along just fine. Real gross domestic product rose 4.4% on an annual pace in last year’s third quarter — the strongest growth in two years amid healthy consumer spending and exports, among other measures. Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook noted that “the overall economy is solid” in a speech at the Economic Club of Miami on Wednesday — a common refrain among economists who point to a layoff rate near historically low levels, a generally low unemployment rate, strong economic growth, and resilient consumer spending. The economy may also need fewer jobs because of slower growth in the workforce. Still, Cook also noted that “recent strong overall growth likely masks a challenging situation facing many families, particularly low- and moderate-income households,” which aligns with persistent reports of bad vibes percolating in American households. On the other hand, higher-income households seem to be doing well in what’s been called a “K-shaped economy.” In the aftermath of the Great Recession, GDP growth also recovered at a quicker pace than jobs, Lisa Simon, chief economist at Revelio Labs, told Yahoo Finance — the same goes for the period after the dot-com bubble burst, which saw its own “jobless expansion.” It’s also possible that AI and promises of productivity growth could keep propelling the economy forward more broadly, Stahle said. “If you’re not looking so much at GDP and the stock market right now and you’re focusing just on the labor market, it definitely seems like the momentum is skewed toward more risks of a downturn at the moment,” Stahle said.

But its free cash flow (FCF) could survive and stay strongly positive, as I will show. Moreover, this provides a great buying opportunity for value investors, as well as cash-secured short-put investors. GOOGL closed at $322.86 , down over 6% from its pre-earnings release peak of $343.69 on Feb. 2. However, it's still up 16.9% from a three-month low of $276.14 on Nov. 14, 2025.

Sign Up Now! A closer look at its results shows why it could be worth more. This article will show why. Strong Operating and Free Cash Flow (FCF) Alphabet is making massive investments in AI. Its capex almost doubled over the last year (+95%) from $14.3 billion in Q4 2024 to $27.9 billion in Q4 2025. For the full-year 2025, capex rose 74% to $91.4 billion. But, despite that huge increase, its free cash flow (FCF) stayed strong, actually rising almost 1% to $73.266 billion. This is because its operating cash flow (OCF) rose 31.5% in 2025 and 34% in Q4 on a YoY basis. This can be seen on page 11 of its earnings slide deck. Alphabet Q4 operating and free cash flow - Earnings slide page 11 However, what is more important here is that the OCF margin rose dramatically. That's the secret to why, despite management's guidance that it will raise its capex spending to between $175 billion and $185 billion in 2026, its free cash flow could stay strong. Let's look at this more carefully. For example, the cash flow statement on page 6 of the earnings release shows that in 2024, operating cash flow was $164.7 billion, representing 40.9% of its $402.8 billion in revenue in 2025. Alphabet OCF and FCF margins - Hake analysis, taken from Q4 cash flow results - page 6 of release But, as the table above shows, the OCF margin was higher than the 35.8% OCF margin in 2024. In other words, cash flow, as a percent of revenue, rose 14.2%, based on its large capex AI-related spending (almost double). So, that implies there could be another large gain in operating cash flow as capex doubles this year, measured as a margin on revenue. The point is that Alphabet's capex investments are paying off. Projecting Operating and Free Cash Flow For example, analysts are projecting revenue will rise 16% this year to $467.22 billion, and by 33% in 2027 to $536.27 billion. So, over the next 12 months (NTM), revenue could average $501.7 billion. However, we might be able to expect that operating cash flow (OCF), as a percent of revenue, could rise 14.5% or so to 46.8 %, just like it did in 2025. So, here is what that means: Story Continues $501.7b x 0.468 OCF margin = $234.8 billion operating cash flow As a result, even if its capex spending rises to $180 billion (the midpoint of guidance), free cash flow (FCF) could be: $235b - $180b = $55 billion FCF And by 2027, assuming a 47% OCF margin: $536.27 x 0.47 = $252 billion OCF $252b - $180b capex = $72 billion FCF Granted, these FCF forecasts are lower than the $73.266 billion in FCF made in 2025. But, it still shows that Alphabet's FCF could stay strong, depending on how its OCF margin improves (as a result of higher capex investments). For example, let's say OCF margins rise to 50% and capex stays at $180 billion: $536b x 0.50 = $268b OCF - $180b capex = $88 billion FCF The bottom line is that the market fears over its huge increase in capex investments need not lead to fears of a huge decline in FCF. How to Play GOOGL One way to conservatively GOOGL stock is to sell short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options. I discussed this in my last Barchart article three weeks ago on Jan. 13 ("" Alphabet Stock Is Still Undervalued According to Analysts - 1 Month GOOGL Puts Yield 2.50% ""). For example, look at the one-month forward puts expiring on March 13. It shows that the $305.00 put option contract has a midpoint premium of $5.93 . In other words, if a short-seller of this put contract secures $30,500 with their brokerage firm, they can immediately receive $593 after entering an order to “Sell to Open” this contract. GOOGL puts expiring 3/13/26 - Barchart - As of Friday, Feb. 6, 2026 That works out to an immediate yield of 1.944% (i.e., $593/$30,500). Moreover, even if GOOGL falls to $305.00, or 5.5% lower than Friday's close, the investor's net cost is: $305.00 - $5.93 = $299.07 breakeven (B/E) In other words, value investors can set a much lower potential buy-in point (i.e., 7.36% lower than $322.86 on Friday) and collect 1.944% while waiting. Some investors could use this capital to buy in-the-money (ITM) call options with much longer expiry periods. I have discussed this kind of play in other Barchart articles. For example, the $305.00 call option expiring on Aug. 21, has a midpoint premium of $47.13. GOOGL Calls expiring 8/21/26 - Barchart - As of Feb. 6, 2026 So, an investor could potentially collect $5.93 for seven months (or $35.58) to help pay for most of this $305 call, leaving a net buy-in cost of $313.55 (i.e., $47.13-$35.58, or $11.55 +$305.00 = $313.55). (Keep in mind there is no guarantee that the one-month put premiums will stay at this level for the same 5.5% OTM distance.) That means the investor could still make a profit, even if GOOGL stays flat at $322.86 today. The bottom line is, there are ways to play GOOGL using OTM puts and ITM calls, for value investors.

This year, though, a cloud has descended over the industry as the big game approached. The stock of Flutter Entertainment Plc, which runs one of the most popular US gambling apps, FanDuel, is on an eight week skid, the longest in 23 years. It’s main competitor, DraftKings, is trading around the lowest levels since 2023, and is down more than 60% from its all-time high five years ago. Most Read from Bloomberg Canadian Province New Brunswick to Quit Using Elon Musk’s X For These Old Bus Stations, It’s Not the End of the Line Milan Olympics Housing Is Built for Easy Reuse NYC Mayor Mamdani Backs Governor Hochul’s Reelection Bid The matchup between Seattle-New England — with less celebrity appeal than last year’s Taylor Swift-soaked event — is partly to blame. But the bigger concern hanging over the industry is the rise of prediction markets like Kalshi, which have come out of nowhere over the last year to offer a new way to bet on sports, bypassing the state-level gambling regulations that have restricted the spread of older gambling apps. Jordan Bender, senior equity analyst at Citizens, is expecting record breaking trading volumes on prediction markets this weekend at the same time that legal wagering on traditional sportsbooks — or handle as it is known — falls 2% from last year. “A big piece of why we think Super Bowl handle will be down is that prediction markets are taking a bite out of that,” Bender said. It is quite the reversal of fortunes for gambling companies that seemed to be riding to ever greater heights in recent years as the American obsession with gambling took off in the wake of a Supreme Court decision in 2018 that allowed states to legalize sports betting. The amount wagered on the Super Bowl has grown for eight years straight. The threat to these businesses came from an unexpected direction. Until early last year, Kalshi, the leading US prediction market startup, was using its status as a federally regulated financial exchange to offer niche financial contracts tied to pop culture events and elections. The agency overseeing all this, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, had indicated that so-called event contracts tied to sports were off limits. Photographer: Don Juan Moore/Getty Images Then Donald Trump won the election. Kalshi tested the waters by offering its first wagers on the Super Bowl in early 2025 and the CFTC did not step in to stop them. Those first contracts were little more than an experiment, but sports have since come to account for more than 90% of the trading volume on Kalshi. Story Continues Several industry analysts still expect the existing US sportsbooks to take in a record Super Bowl haul this year. Ed Birkin, a senior analyst with H2 Gambling Capital, is forecasting that total wagers — before prediction markets are taken into account — will jump 9% from last year, to $1.78 billion. But said he expects prediction markets will attract $630 million in bets for the Super Bowl and account for 80% of the year-over-year growth in wagering activity for the event. Wall Street analysts’ average fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share estimate for Flutter have plunged a whopping 49% over the past three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while revenue expectations have taken a 6.3% hit. For DraftKings, earnings estimates are down 29% while revenue projections have fallen 2.6% in the same period. Some gambling executives have said that prediction markets are not threatening them in states where they are already operating and are instead primarily gaining ground in the dozen or so states where traditional online gambling is not allowed, including big ones like California and Texas. BetMGM, which has its own online sports app, announced this week that it attracted record sports bets in the fourth quarter of 2024, helping drive a 63% jump in revenues from a year earlier. “We can’t see any impact that we can identify that is attributable to prediction markets,” the company’s chief executive officer, Adam Greenblatt, said in an interview. Greenblatt said the newcomers have also drawn much of their business from the more skilled bettors — known as sharps — who tend to be less profitable for gambling companies. Older gambling apps, meanwhile, are running up against the limits of their expansion across the country, after the rapid growth that immediately followed the Supreme Court decision. This year, the only new state to allow legal betting on the Super Bowl is Missouri, a relatively small market. “The Super Bowl 60 outlook reflects a transition from expansion-driven growth to incremental growth as nearly all states with a viable path to legalization are already live,” Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey wrote in a note to clients on Jan. 29. Still, even in states where gambling has been legal — the strongholds of DraftKings and FanDuel — there have been signs of weakness. Around 10% of DraftKings users were also using Kalshi in January, and Kalshi’s app was downloaded four times as much as either FanDuel or DraftKings, according to the data firm Apptopia. Part of the allure of Kalshi is that it is using its novel structure to open up betting on everything from the length of the half time show to the likelihood of Jeff Bezos attending the event, while DraftKings and FanDuel are almost exclusively focused on the scoring and outcome of the game. “Kalshi’s growth is fueled by ad campaigns, earned media, social virality and, above all, superior depth, breadth, and distribution compared to traditional online sportsbooks,” analyst Edwin Dorsey wrote in one of several recent posts on Substack about why he is bearish on DraftKings. DraftKings and FanDuel have been taking the threat seriously. In December they both launched their own prediction market apps, which are now available in all the states where their traditional apps are not allowed. But together they got just under 100,000 downloads in January, compared with Kalshi’s 1.9 million downloads, according to Sensor Tower data. On Friday, DraftKings announced that it had struck a partnership with another early prediction market exchange, Crypto.com, to offer a wider array of event contracts. Gaming regulators in several states have gone to court to try to shut Kalshi and its peers down, and many analysts assume these cases will eventually go to the Supreme Court. But in the meantime, the new chair of the CFTC, Michael Selig, recently indicated that he will allow sports contracts to move forward and is not planning to cede oversight of the territory to the states. --With assistance from Christopher Palmeri.

Last week, those concerns suddenly spilled over into the stock market. The culprit was AI startup Anthropic, which released new tools designed to automate work tasks in various industries, from legal and data services to financial research. The announcements sparked fears that the innovations would doom countless businesses. In response, investors dumped a broad range of stocks, from Expedia Group Inc. to Salesforce Inc. to London Stock Exchange Group Plc. Most Read from Bloomberg Canadian Province New Brunswick to Quit Using Elon Musk’s X For These Old Bus Stations, It’s Not the End of the Line Milan Olympics Housing Is Built for Easy Reuse NYC Mayor Mamdani Backs Governor Hochul’s Reelection Bid By Friday, dip buyers stepped in, helping the widely followed iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF, better known by its ticker IGV, rebound from its 12% decline over the previous four sessions. But for bleary-eyed Wall Street pros, rattled by days of volatile trading, the message was clear: This is the new reality. “Things are shipping out weekly, daily,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the Futurum Group. “The blast radius of companies that could be impacted by AI is going to grow daily.” Even with the end-of-week rebound, the damage was severe. Thomson Reuters Corp.’s Canada-listed shares plunged 20% on the week, their steepest fall ever. Financial research firm Morningstar Inc. posted its worst week in the stock market since 2009. Software makers HubSpot Inc., Atlassian Corp. and Zscaler Inc. each tumbled more than 16%. All told, a collection of 164 stocks in the software, financial services and asset management sectors shed $611 billion in market value last week. (Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with LSEG, Thomson Reuters and Morningstar in providing financial data and news. Bloomberg Law sells legal research tools and software.) AI’s disruptive potential has been a topic of conversation since the debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late 2022. But until last week, most of the attention has been on the winners. With hundreds of billions of dollars being spent to beef up computing capacity, investors eagerly bought the shares of companies considered beneficiaries of the largesse, from chipmakers and networking firms to energy providers and materials producers. That strategy has paid off handsomely. An index that tracks semiconductor-related stocks has more than tripled since the end of 2022, compared with a 61% advance for IGV and an 81% jump in the S&P 500 Index. Story Continues While the so-called pick-and-shovel trade is still winning, the rapid pace of new tools being brought to market by startups like Anthropic and OpenAI, as well as Alphabet Inc.’s Google, is making the long-theorized disruption seem much more imminent. In just the past month, Google roiled video-game stocks with the release of a tool that can create an immersive digital world with simple image or text prompts. And another Anthropic release, a work assistant based on its Claude coding service, sent software stocks tumbling. The developments added to angst fueled by a set of disappointing earnings reports from software makers late last month. The biggest was Microsoft Corp., which lost $357 billion of market value in a single day after slowing revenue growth in its cloud-computing business fanned anxieties about heavy spending on AI. ServiceNow Inc. sank 10% and SAP SE tumbled 15% following similarly lackluster results. “It was the stalwarts that failed us,” said Jackson Ader, a software analyst at KeyBanc. “If your results and your guidance aren’t up to snuff, it’s kind of like: What confidence should we have for the rest of the sector?” While plenty of new names were bruised last week, few have been punished to the extent of traditional software makers, which have been under pressure since last year. Salesforce, which owns the popular team collaboration service Slack, is down 48% from a record high in December 2024. ServiceNow, which makes software for human resources and information technology operations, has dropped 57% since hitting a peak in January 2025. “I suspect some companies will endure, embrace AI, and prosper, but others will see permanent disruption to their business models or prospects,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors. “It is very hard to know which is which right now.” That fear has investors running for the exits. Software is by far the most net-sold group among all sectors since the start of the year, according to Goldman’s prime brokerage desk data. Hedge funds’ net exposure to software hit a record low of less than 3% as of Feb 3, down from a peak of 18% in 2023. However, there’s little fundamental evidence of deterioration. In fact, in the eyes of Wall Street analysts, the outlook for profits is improving. Earnings for software and services companies in the S&P 500 are projected to rise 19% in 2026, up from projections for 16% growth a few months ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. “Everyone is assuming the bottom is going to fall out, in terms of operating metrics. I’m skeptical about that,” said Michael Mullaney, director of global market research at Boston Partners. “It could end up that profits and margins are fine, even if there is disruption. If I were a growth manager, I’d be buying the dip.” The relentless selling has pushed software stocks deep into territory where technical-minded traders typically expect a rebound. The 14-day relative strength index on the iShares ETF hit 15 on Thursday, the lowest level in almost 15 years, and is around 24 now. Anything below 30 is considered oversold. Meanwhile, valuations keep getting cheaper. A basket of software stocks tracked by Goldman Sachs sank to a record low of 21 times estimated profits, down from a peak of more than 100 in late 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Salesforce is trading at 14 times profit expected over the next 12 months, compared with an average of 46 over the past decade. “We continue to test the valuation floor and then blow right through it,” KeyBanc’s Ader said. “People are gun-shy and skittish to say that these stocks are too cheap, because based on historical multiples you could have made that argument at every point for many many months now, and it wouldn’t have helped you one bit.” --With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich.

AT&T is also collaborating with Amazon Leo, Amazon’s low-Earth-orbit satellite business, enabling expanded fixed broadband for business customers in underserved areas where traditional networks lag. The market responded favorably to the announcement, sending AT&T’s shares up 1.5% on Wednesday, Feb. 4. With investors warming to the strategy, attention now turns to whether this partnership can drive sustained momentum and unlock further upside for the stock. About AT&T Stock Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, AT&T is a global telecom and technology provider delivering wireless connectivity, broadband, and network services. With a market cap nearing $192.3 billion, the company supplies mobile plans, internet access, voice solutions, and managed connectivity, while also selling smartphones and devices through retail and digital channels. AT&T’s recent stock performance reinforces the improving narrative. Over the past 52 weeks, T stock has gained 10.96%. Momentum accelerated over the past month with a 11.46% rise, while the most recent five trading sessions alone delivered an 3.5% jump. www.barchart.com Valuation still leans conservative, with T stock trading at 11.82 times forward adjusted earnings, a level below the industry average that points to a clear relative discount. Story continues Income continues to anchor the investment case. AT&T pays an annual dividend of $1.11 per share, translating to a yield of 4.06%. The most recent quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share was paid on Feb. 2 to shareholders of record as of Jan. 12. AT&T Surpasses Q4 Earnings On Jan. 28, AT&T's shares jumped 4.7% after the company reported Q4 2025 results that exceeded expectations and issued stronger-than-expected guidance for the next three years. Revenue rose 3.6% year-over-year (YOY) to $33.5 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $32.7 billion. Adjusted EPS climbed 20.9% to $0.52, surpassing analyst forecasts of $0.46. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA rose 4.1% from the year-ago value to $11.2 billion, highlighting improving efficiency across the business. Subscriber momentum added credibility to the results. The quarter produced 283,000 AT&T Fiber net additions and 221,000 AT&T Internet Air net additions. More than half a million combined advanced home internet net additions for the second consecutive quarter underscored sustained demand for high-speed connectivity. Looking ahead, management expects consolidated adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% to 4% in 2026, improving to 5% or better by 2028. They forecast adjusted EPS of $2.25 to $2.35 in 2026, with a double-digit three-year CAGR projected through 2028. Cash flow guidance adds another layer of confidence. Management expects free cash flow to grow by more than $1 billion in 2027 and approximately $2 billion in 2028, driven primarily by adjusted EBITDA growth, supporting dividends, reinvestment, and balance-sheet flexibility. Analysts broadly align with management’s outlook. Consensus estimates call for Q1 2026 EPS of $0.55, reflecting 7.8% YOY growth. Longer-term forecasts project fiscal year 2026 earnings of $2.31, up 9%, followed by a further 10% increase to $2.54 in fiscal year 2027. What Do Analysts Expect for AT&T Stock? Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft recently raised his price target on T stock to $33 from $31 and reiterated a “Buy” rating. He cited the company’s strong Q4 2025 performance and emphasized the significance of the company’s new three-year guidance. Overall, Wall Street has assigned T stock a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating. Out of 28 analysts, 15 recommend “Strong Buy,” three suggest “Moderate Buy,” nine advise “Hold,” and one issues a “Strong Sell.” The average price target of $29.60 implies potential upside of 9%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $34 points to a gain of 25% from current levels. www.barchart.com www.barchart.com On the date of publication, Aanchal Sugandh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

2026-02-08 23:29:29,Why I am still taking these tech stocks to task Tech stocks are not getting any love from me after a wild week.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-i-am-still-taking-these-tech-stocks-to-task-133012952.html,"In this article: GOOG NFLX ARM QCOM OPAI.PVT This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings If you are looking to be consoled after 25% in value was sliced off your software stock holdings this week, then click out of this and go about your day. Because I'm not here to offer up sloppy kisses and warm hugs. I'm in a mood to dish out some pain on two fronts. One is to you — the investors I love so much — as these painful losses could have been avoided. All you had to do was what I have suggested time and time again: take frequent pulse checks in the companies you own. So many software stocks were priced for perfection (and still are) coming into the year, and the backdrop was far from perfect. AI updates out of Anthropic ( ANTH.PVT ) and Google ( GOOG , GOOGL ) are calling into question the long-term value of software companies. Meanwhile, these stocks were bid up to aggressive valuations in part because of hopes of additional interest rate cuts. Well, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told you last week those weren't coming anytime soon. And the Kevin Warsh announcement as Fed chair nominee hasn't helped matters. The entire software investment thesis has been blown up. I also want to hand out pain to a few tech companies that I lightly touched on during Opening Bid late in the week. First, Qualcomm ( QCOM ). Qualcomm's guidance stunk, and the sell-off on Thursday was deserved. The company called out weakness in the smartphone market, largely due to the global memory chip shortage. Execs said this dynamic could persist into 2027. An outlook like this should have been teed up by management three months ago. Come on, guys, do better! Expect Qualcomm shares to stay in the penalty box. ""Smartphone headwinds an ongoing concern; AI chip potential still unclear,"" HSBC analyst Frank Lee said. The next tech giant in line is chip player Arm Holdings ( ARM ). Arm also served up some less-than-savory guidance, blaming memory chip shortages. Keep in mind that Arm designs the architecture that forms ⁠the basis of a large chunk of the ‌world's smartphone chips. That leaves it with the prospect of subdued royalty sales amid soft mobile processor sales. Similar to what I just said about Qualcomm, Arm execs should've done a better job guiding investors to these challenges. Instead, investors in both companies are left holding the bag. Arm shares are also likely to stay in the penalty box. And I know you want me to lay into Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ) for shocking the hell out of everyone by calling out up to $185 billion in capital expenditures this year. The Street estimate was around $120 billion. Story Continues But I'm not going to lay into Alphabet for one simple reason: The fundamentals of its business are so strong that you can justify this level of spending. Check out these two random numbers I yanked from the earnings call transcript . In October, YouTube viewers watched more than 700 million hours of podcasts on living room devices, up 75% from a year ago. The company has 8 million paid seats of Gemini Enterprise, which it launched just four months ago. And the Gemini app now has more than 750 million monthly active users. These are huge numbers that should have OpenAI ( OPAI.PVT ) quaking in its boots. ""The quarter strengthen thesis that: 1) Google search activity will accelerate from new AI use cases (not losing queries to OpenAI), 2) AI can structurally drive higher Search monetization, 3) Gemini large language models and TPUs are cloud competitive advantages, and 4) Cloud capex is high return on investment, and more capacity will accelerate cloud growth,"" BofA analyst Justin Post said. Is this coming week one where you bottom-hunt in software? I will leave you with this thought: Have you ever tried catching a falling knife with bare hands? My point exactly. Stock spotlight: e.l.f. Beauty I've had the good fortune of being in finance in various capacities for 22 years. And a lot of you remember when I was an analyst writing research reports and making stock calls. I appreciate you riding with me all these years. You have told me lately that you miss me picking stocks. I feel you, but this is a different point in my life and career. However, I will try to do a better job at whipping up short analyses when possible on stocks that leave an impression on me one way or another. To that end... Hailey Bieber's power to drive the cosmetics industry seemingly has no bounds. That's one of my thoughts as I reran the numbers this week on e.l.f. Beauty's ( ELF ) latest quarter, which was powered by the company spending $1 billion to buy Bieber's cosmetics brand, Rhode, last August. E.l.f. hiked its top- and bottom-line outlooks for the year because of momentum with Rhode, but also because of new shelf space wins at Walmart ( WMT ) and Dollar General ( DG ). Yet the stock sold off by 6% on Thursday. It's off by 63% from the February 2024 highs. I don't love the cosmetics industry. It's volatile, competitive, and very hit-driven. But I will say this: The Street could be missing things a little on e.l.f. I liked what CEO Tarang Amin told me about demand trends for Rhode on Opening Bid and how the core business of lower-priced cosmetics is performing at major retailers. I also like that the company has gained a lot of new shelf space at those aforementioned two retailers, as well as Target ( TGT ). Take that for what it is.

The question for investors is whether ​Takaichi's electoral momentum will prompt her to expand her stimulus ambitions or if it lends her the political leeway to proceed more ‌cautiously.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japan-markets-set-renewed-takaichi-132924343.html,"In this article: JPY=X By Rocky Swift TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Japan's volatile financial markets must now contend with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi firmly in the driver's seat after her decisive victory on Sunday, which hands her an electoral mandate to reflate the economy. The question for investors is whether ​Takaichi's electoral momentum will prompt her to expand her stimulus ambitions or if it lends her the political leeway to proceed more ‌cautiously. Since she began her rise to become the nation's first female premier in October, the ""Takaichi trade"" has pushed domestic shares to record highs while causing a precipitous selloff in Japanese government bonds ‌and the yen. Voters braved heavy snowfalls in Tokyo and other parts of Japan to deliver what exit polls indicated to be the most decisive win for Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party since 1996. ""The stock market is a true believer in Takaichi, so the big win is going to be good news for equities when the markets open on Monday,"" said Chris Scicluna, the head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe. Takaichi, a devotee of the ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies of the late premier Shinzo Abe, has ⁠pledged a proactive fiscal policy funded largely through bond ‌issuance. She came to office at a low point in power and popularity for her Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-World War Two period, forcing her to bargain with opposition parties with even more liberal fiscal ‍platforms. ""The administration's foundation will become much more stable, making it easier for expectations to build around advancing economic policy,"" said Kota Suzuki, a strategist at Nomura Asset Management. ""Because there will no longer be a need to actively seek the opposition's cooperation, there will be less pressure for giveaway-style fiscal expansion."" With polls already indicating a decisive LDP win, Japan's benchmark ​Nikkei 225 Index set an all-time high of 54,782.83 on Tuesday. Big winners of late include sectors like defence, artificial intelligence and chips that ‌have been singled out by Takaichi for targeted investment. But prospects for more government outlays have unsettled investors already concerned about Japan's debt burden, the largest in the developed world. Those worries came to a head on January 20, when rates across the JGB yield curve shot to multi-decade or even record highs after Takaichi called for the snap election and embraced suspending the sales tax on food. The yen has also been punished, losing about 6% against the dollar since Takaichi's selection as prime minister in October and plumbing record lows against the euro and Swiss franc. Only threats of joint currency market intervention with the United ⁠States have arrested the yen's slide. Story Continues The size of Takaichi's victory means ""the Takaichi trade will ​revive, which means JGB yields will be under upward pressure,"" said Naoya Hasegawa, the chief bond ​strategist at Okasan Securities. ""The move of the yen, stocks and bond yields will affect each other. If the yen falls rapidly, yields will tend to rise."" While JGB yields remain elevated, some measure of calm has returned to the market in the past ‍couple of weeks, as confidence grew that ⁠an emboldened Takaichi would keep her pledge of ""responsible"" stimulus. The past four debt auctions have seen resilient demand, and 30-year JGB yields have fallen 31.5 basis points since their record high of 3.88% on January 20. ""We assume Takaichi will continue to strike a delicate balance between proactive fiscal ⁠policy and fiscal discipline,"" said Shigeto Nagai of Oxford Economics in Tokyo. ""Although we think she's determined to make the best use of the fiscal space generated by inflation-boosted tax revenue, we ‌also believe she seriously worries about a further rise in JGB yields,"" he added.

Sectors seen benefiting from her “strategic” spending plans, including AI, semiconductors, quantum computing and defense, have powered the climb and were among Monday’s best performers. Takaichi’s win “far surpassed” initial expectations, and “has the potential to open the floodgates on her expansionary policies,” wrote Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors, in a note. He expects upside for defense-related stocks, as Takaichi has pledged to increase security spending, along with space-related names. Financial stocks will also win out due to higher long-term bond yields, he added, while food-linked shares may benefit from Takaichi’s election promise of a temporary cut to the consumption tax on food. Defense manufacturers Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., IHI Corp. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. were all strong Monday, with Kawasaki Heavy soaring 16%, helped by better-than-expected earnings. Cable makers Furukawa Electric Co. and Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. were also strong, while real estate and construction stocks, also expected to benefit from Takaichi’s policies, were among the Topix’s best performers.

Most Read from Bloomberg Canadian Province New Brunswick to Quit Using Elon Musk’s X For These Old Bus Stations, It’s Not the End of the Line Milan Olympics Housing Is Built for Easy Reuse NYC Mayor Mamdani Backs Governor Hochul’s Reelection Bid Gold’s ability to stabilize above the $5,000 threshold “will be critical in determining whether the market can transition from a reactive bounce to a more sustainable advance,” said Ahmad Assiri, an analyst at Pepperstone Group Ltd. Data over the weekend showed that the Chinese central bank extended gold purchases for a 15th month, underscoring resilient official demand — a major component of an extended bull run that preceded the recent rout. Such purchases will continue, the official Securities Times reported, with relatively small-scale purchases helping the People’s Bank of China to diversify its assets without causing price volatility. Precious metals had been on a record-breaking ascent, driven by heightened geopolitical risks, the debasement trade and concerns about the Federal Reserve’s independence. A wave of speculative buying added fuel to the run before gold and silver crashed at the end of last month. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent cited “unruly” trading in China as a reason behind last week’s wild price swings. Despite a week of choppy trading since the historic reversal, banks and asset managers including Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Pictet Asset Management have backed bullion to recover due to long-term demand drivers, such as the wider diversification away from US assets, policy uncertainties and elevated central-bank buying. Chinese regulators have advised financial institutions to rein in their holdings of US Treasuries, citing concerns over concentration risks and market volatility, according to people familiar with the matter. Officials urged banks to limit purchases of US government bonds and instructed those with high exposure to pare down their positions, the people said. For silver, market moves have been more violent than for gold, amplified by speculative momentum and thinner over-the-counter trading. The white metal — which has lost more than a third since hitting a record peak — rose as much as 6% on Monday to top $82 an ounce. Story continues Looking ahead, traders will be looking to upcoming US economic data for clues on the Fed’s policy direction. The January jobs report due Wednesday is expected to show signs of labor market stabilizing, and inflation data is scheduled for Friday. Adding to concerns about the Fed’s independence, President Donald Trump’s nominee to become the next Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, voiced support for a new accord between the US central bank and the Treasury Department. Gold climbed 1.5% to $5,038.39 an ounce as of 2:12 p.m. in Singapore. Silver advanced 5.8% to $82.32. Platinum was little changed, while palladium rose. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the US currency, was down 0.2%. —With assistance from Masaki Kondo.

Keeping that in mind, here is one low-volatility stock providing safe-and-steady growth and two that may not deliver the returns you need. Two Stocks to Sell: CarMax (KMX) Rolling One-Year Beta: 0.71 Known for its transparent, customer-centric approach and wide selection of vehicles, Carmax (NYSE:KMX) is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. Why Is KMX Risky? Weak same-store sales trends over the past two years suggest there may be few opportunities in its core markets to open new locations Commoditized inventory, bad unit economics, and high competition are reflected in its low gross margin of 11% 16× net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio shows it’s overleveraged and increases the probability of shareholder dilution if things turn unexpectedly At $46.98 per share, CarMax trades at 19.7x forward P/E.

2026-02-09 23:35:57,A Big AppLovin Critic Walked Back Some Of Its Claims. The Stock Jumped. AppLovin shares soared Monday after publisher CapitalWatch retracted accusations against a shareholder of the adtech darling.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-applovin-critic-walked-back-221934569.html,"In this article: APP ^GSPC Key Takeaways AppLovin shares soared Monday after CapitalWatch retracted accusations from a report about a shareholder of the adtech company. CapitalWatch said an internal review found the claims tying a shareholder to criminal organizations didn't meet its standards. One of AppLovin's most vocal critics is walking back some of its claims. Shares of AppLovin ( APP ) jumped over 13% Monday, leading gainers on the S&P 500, after CapitalWatch—a self-described ""vigilante of capital flowing in and out of stock markets""—over the weekend posted a correction and apology on social media regarding some of its accusations against a shareholder. Why This Matters to Investors Monday's surge could point to greater confidence in AppLovin's stock, which has been the target of several short sellers and drawn scrutiny from regulators in recent months. ""We are formally retracting specific characterizations and allegations contained therein regarding Mr. Tang Hao,"" said CapitalWatch, adding that determined money-laundering claims in a report last month linking him to criminal organizations didn't meet its standards. CapitalWatch, which has said it has no financial interest in AppLovin, said its retraction hasn't changed its stance about the adtech company, which CapitalWatch has previously called ""the ultimate monument to 21st-century new-type transnational financial crime."" Its Jan. 20 report alleged ""systemic compliance risks and suspicions of major financial crimes within the core capital structure"" of AppLovin, saying the company ""views Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws as non-existent."" CapitalWatch said it plans to issue a fresh report on AppLovin that will ""raise professional and necessary inquiries regarding figures that lack reasonable explanation."" AppLovin last month sent a cease and desist letter to CapitalWatch demanding it retract its claims, which the company called ""defamatory and baseless."" Despite Monday's gains, shares of AppLovin—which late last year joined the S&P 500 index —have lost about 37% from December's highs amid heightened scrutiny. Still, the stock is up about 20% from this time a year ago. Read the original article on Investopedia View Comments"

These tools, featuring integrations from Insurify and Tuio, allow users to compare and purchase policies via AI, bypassing the ""middleman"" role.

The previous big move we wrote about was 13 days ago when the stock dropped 4.7% on the news that a U.S. government proposal for nearly flat Medicare payment rates in 2027 dragged down health insurer stocks. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services outlined a proposal to raise payment rates for private Medicare Advantage plans by only 0.09% for 2027. This figure fell far short of what Wall Street expected, triggering a broad sell-off across the industry. Major insurers like Humana, UnitedHealth, and CVS Health saw their shares fall sharply. Arthur J. Gallagher, which offers and shops for Medicare-related products including Medicare Advantage plans, was caught in the downturn as investor concern spread across the sector. Arthur J. Gallagher is down 14.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $219.68 per share, it is trading 37% below its 52-week high of $348.77 from June 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Arthur J.

As of Feb. 6, 59% of S&P 500 ( ^GSPC ) companies have reported fourth quarter results, according to FactSet data , and Wall Street analysts estimate a 13% increase in earnings per share for the fourth quarter. If that rate holds, it would represent the 10th consecutive quarter of annual earnings growth for the index and the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. S&P 500 earnings growth estimates. (Chart: FactSet) Heading into the reporting period, analysts were expecting an 8.3% jump in earnings per share, down from the third quarter's 13.6% earnings growth rate. Wall Street has raised its earnings expectations in recent months, especially for tech companies, which have driven earnings growth in recent quarters. Massive Big Tech capital expenditures set the tone for the AI trade.

LIVE 142 updates Today at 9:51 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Chegg earnings beat estimates, but the stock falls as competition from AI grows Chegg's ( CHGG ) fourth quarter results were better than expected, but earnings and revenue declined from a year ago as the student platform navigates disruption from artificial intelligence. Chegg reported an adjusted loss of $0.01, which was narrower than the $0.10 loss Wall Street was expecting, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company reported earnings of $0.17 per share in the same quarter a year ago. Chegg's $72.66 million in sales also beat the Street's estimate of $71 million. The first quarter revenue outlook, however, fell short. Chegg said it expects revenue between $60 million and $62 million, whereas the Street was looking for $64 million in revenue. Last October, Chegg announced mass layoffs and an aggressive pivot to reskilling as the company looks to withstand greater competition from OpenAI's ( OPAI.PVT ) Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ). The two companies have rolled out new study tools for their AI chatbots, ChatGPT and Gemini, and Chegg has also sued Google over its AI-generated search summaries, which have hurt traffic. “We are reinventing Chegg around the $40 billion skilling market, which we believe can drive double-digit growth with strong margins and cash flow in the years to come,” Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig said in the Q4 earnings release. “We’ve organized the company into two focused businesses: Chegg Skilling as our growth engine and our legacy Academic Services, which generates free cash flow that strengthens our balance sheet and positions us to end 2026 debt-free with a substantial cash balance.” Chegg stock fell 5% in extended trading.

Today at 9:36 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell On Semiconductor stock slides after Q4 earnings miss On Semiconductor ( ON ) stock skidded in after-hours trading on Monday, falling by 7%, after the company recorded lower profits in the fourth quarter than a year ago but said it's seeing ""signs of stabilization"" in its key markets. The chipmaker reported earnings per share of $0.45 on revenue of $1.53 billion, missing earnings estimates of $0.59 per share and falling below earnings per share of $0.88 in the same period a year ago, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company's fourth quarter revenue was in line with estimates. The company saw annual sales declines across all of its business groups: Power Solutions, Analog & Mixed Signal, and Intelligent Sensing. Intelligent Sensing was the only segment that saw sales grow quarter over quarter, while Power Solutions and Analog & Mixed Signal sales fell 2% and 5%, respectively. For the first quarter, On Semiconductor expects revenue in the range of $1.43 billion to $1.53 billion, which has a midpoint below the consensus estimate of $1.5 billion. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $0.56 and $0.66; Wall Street expects $0.61.

Today at 1:00 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Monday.com stock dives over 14% as guidance disappoints Monday.com shares tanked 14% after the software maker beat earnings estimates but posted guidance that disappointed Wall Street. In the fourth quarter, Monday.com reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.04, beating estimates of $0.92. Revenue grew 25% year over year to $333.9 million, also beating expectations of $329.6 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence consensus estimates. However, the company's first quarter revenue guidance of $338 million to $340 million came in below expectations of $342 million. Operating income is expected in a range of $37 million to $39 million, compared to the $45 million the Street was expecting. The stock faced significant losses recently as part of a sell-off in software stocks, as investors questioned whether the disruption from artificial intelligence could take a bigger bite out of these companies' profits than previously expected. Year to date, Monday.com stock is down 33%. Today at 12:49 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Cleveland-Cliffs stock drops after revenue misses estimates Cleveland-Cliffs ( CLF ) stock fell more than 3% after fourth quarter revenue missed expectations. The steel producer recorded a net loss per share of $0.44, which was narrower than the $0.60 loss Wall Street was expecting, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $4.3 billion fell short of estimates of $4.5 billion. Cleveland-Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves cited weakness in the auto sector, a ""value-destructive"" slab contract, and a negative situation in the Canadian market as reasons for the revenue miss. “Our performance in 2025 was negatively affected by persistently weak production levels from the automotive sector throughout the entire year, an expiring five-year slab contract becoming value-destructive during its last year, and a newly adverse dynamic in the Canadian market,"" Goncalves said in a statement. ""Fortunately, as we started 2026, these negative situations have all improved."" In the fourth quarter, Cleveland-Cliffs had 3.77 million net tons in steel shipments, compared to 3.8 million tons in the same period a year earlier. For 2026, Cleveland-Cliffs expects to ship 16.5 million to 17 million tons of steel.

Thu, February 5, 2026 at 9:18 PM UTC Grace O'Donnell Strategy reports quarterly loss as the stock gets crushed by bitcoin sell-off Strategy stock ( MSTR ) tumbled 17% on Thursday before taking another 1% hit after-hours following the release of its fourth quarter earnings. The software company led by Michael Saylor pioneered the model for companies to hoard bitcoin in corporate treasuries. These days, it’s seen as an investment proxy for bitcoin, with that side of the business becoming its organizing principle. The gambit seemed to work last year when bitcoin advanced higher and higher on hopes of easier regulation. But as the sell-off in bitcoin intensified on Thursday, it highlighted the risks in Strategy's long-term holding strategy that could make it harder for the company to raise capital. Strategy currently holds 713,502 bitcoins with an average purchase price of $76,052. On Thursday, bitcoin's spot price fell to around $63,000, bringing the company's unrealized losses to about $8.9 billion. ""HODL,"" Saylor tweeted on Thursday, referring to a tongue-in-cheek term in the crypto community that has evolved to mean ""hold on for dear life."" For the fourth quarter, Strategy reported an operating loss of $17.4 billion, compared to an operating loss of $1 billion in Q4 2024. It also reported a net loss of $12.4 billion, or $42.93 per share, well below the $5.5 billion loss to $6.3 billion profit range the company indicated in December, when it slashed its forecast from a net profit of $24 billion. The Street was expecting a loss of $20.99 per share. In the software operations, revenue increased 1.9% year over year to $123 million, driven by strong growth in product licenses and subscription services. In December, Strategy also created a US dollar reserve worth $2.25 billion, which the company said provides more than two and a half years of funds to cover its dividend. Remarking on the reserve, CFO Andrew Kang said that ""Strategy’s capital structure is stronger and more resilient today than ever before.” Listen to Strategy's earnings call live on the stock quote page.

For the fiscal second quarter, Peloton recorded a basic loss per share of $0.09, wider than the $0.06 loss expected. Revenue was $656.5 million in the quarter, below expectations for $675.1 million, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Subscriptions to its connected fitness service dropped 7% year over year to 2.66 million after the company raised prices at the beginning of October. Peloton also forecast a challenging quarter ahead as the company transforms its product lineup and tries to stabilize shrinking sales. The company has added new features to its lineup, including a CrossFit training series, as it attempts to revamp offerings. In its fiscal third quarter, Peloton expects subscriptions to decrease by 8% year over year to a range of 2.65 million to 2.67 million.

Its GAAP profit of $0.36 per share was 41% below analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Goodyear? Find out in our full research report . Goodyear (GT) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $4.92 billion vs analyst estimates of $4.86 billion (flat year on year, 1.3% beat) EPS (GAAP): $0.36 vs analyst expectations of $0.61 (41% miss) Operating Margin: 6.6%, up from 5.3% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 27.2%, up from 20.5% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $3.02 billion ""We delivered another strong quarter, driven by execution of our Goodyear Forward plan,"" said Mark Stewart, chief executive officer and president. Company Overview With its iconic blimp floating above major sporting events since 1925, Goodyear (NYSE:GT) is one of the world's largest tire manufacturers, producing and selling tires for automobiles, trucks, aircraft, and other vehicles, along with related services. Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Luckily, Goodyear’s sales grew at a decent 8.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth was slightly above the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Goodyear Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss cycles, industry trends, or a company capitalizing on catalysts such as a new contract win or a successful product line. Goodyear’s recent performance marks a sharp pivot from its five-year trend as its revenue has shown annualized declines of 4.8% over the last two years. Goodyear isn’t alone in its struggles as the Automobile Manufacturing industry experienced a cyclical downturn, with many similar businesses observing lower sales at this time. Goodyear Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Goodyear’s $4.92 billion of revenue was flat year on year but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 1.3%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 2% over the next 12 months. While this projection implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance, it is still below average for the sector. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without. Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Story Continues Operating Margin Goodyear was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 3.6% was weak for an industrials business. This result isn’t too surprising given its low gross margin as a starting point. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Goodyear’s operating margin decreased by 3 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. We’ve noticed many Automobile Manufacturing companies also saw their margins fall (along with revenue, as mentioned above) because the cycle turned in the wrong direction, but Goodyear’s performance was poor no matter how you look at it. It shows that costs were rising and it couldn’t pass them onto its customers. Goodyear Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, Goodyear generated an operating margin profit margin of 6.6%, up 1.3 percentage points year on year. Since its gross margin expanded more than its operating margin, we can infer that leverage on its cost of sales was the primary driver behind the recently higher efficiency. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Goodyear’s earnings losses deepened over the last five years as its EPS dropped 2.3% annually. We tend to steer our readers away from companies with falling EPS, where diminishing earnings could imply changing secular trends and preferences. If the tide turns unexpectedly, Goodyear’s low margin of safety could leave its stock price susceptible to large downswings. Goodyear Trailing 12-Month EPS (GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a more recent period because it can provide insight into an emerging theme or development for the business. For Goodyear, its two-year annual EPS declines of 57.4% show it’s continued to underperform. These results were bad no matter how you slice the data. In Q4, Goodyear reported EPS of $0.36, up from $0.26 in the same quarter last year. Despite growing year on year, this print missed analysts’ estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street is optimistic. Analysts forecast Goodyear’s full-year EPS of negative $5.99 will flip to positive $1.02. Key Takeaways from Goodyear’s Q4 Results It was good to see Goodyear narrowly top analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. On the other hand, its EPS missed. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 2.1% to $10.29 immediately following the results. Goodyear underperformed this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now? We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle.

Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Over the last five years, Medpace grew its sales at an excellent 22.3% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. Medpace Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Medpace’s annualized revenue growth of 15.8% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Medpace Year-On-Year Revenue Growth We can dig further into the company’s sales dynamics by analyzing its organic revenue, which strips out one-time events like acquisitions and currency fluctuations that don’t accurately reflect its fundamentals. Over the last two years, Medpace’s organic revenue averaged 15.9% year-on-year growth. Because this number aligns with its two-year revenue growth, we can see the company’s core operations (not acquisitions and divestitures) drove most of its results. Story Continues Medpace Organic Revenue Growth This quarter, Medpace reported wonderful year-on-year revenue growth of 32%, and its $708.5 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 3.3%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 10.8% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. Still, this projection is healthy and indicates the market is forecasting success for its products and services. While Wall Street chases Nvidia at all-time highs, an under-the-radar semiconductor supplier is dominating a critical AI component these giants can’t build without.

Operating Margin Operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D. Medpace has managed its cost base well over the last five years. It demonstrated solid profitability for a healthcare business, producing an average operating margin of 19.7%. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Medpace’s operating margin rose by 3.8 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. The company’s two-year trajectory shows its performance was mostly driven by its recent improvements. These data points are very encouraging and show momentum is on its side. Medpace Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, Medpace generated an operating margin profit margin of 21.6%, down 1.7 percentage points year on year. This reduction is quite minuscule and indicates the company’s overall cost structure has been relatively stable. Earnings Per Share We track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company’s growth is profitable. Medpace’s EPS grew at an astounding 31.7% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 22.3% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became more profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded. Medpace Trailing 12-Month EPS (GAAP) Diving into the nuances of Medpace’s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, Medpace’s operating margin declined this quarter but expanded by 3.8 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also shrank by 23.1%, and these factors together are positive signs for shareholders because improving profitability and share buybacks turbocharge EPS growth relative to revenue growth. Medpace Diluted Shares Outstanding In Q4, Medpace reported EPS of $4.67, up from $3.67 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts’ estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Medpace’s full-year EPS of $15.30 to grow 9.5%. Key Takeaways from Medpace’s Q4 Results We were impressed by how significantly Medpace blew past analysts’ organic revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year EPS guidance outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. The market seemed to be hoping for more, and the stock traded down 3.6% to $512.14 immediately after reporting. Should you buy the stock or not? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

Wilson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Company Overview With 19 different brands across the globe, Columbus McKinnon (NASDAQ:CMCO) offers material handling equipment for the construction, manufacturing, and transportation industries. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Luckily, Columbus McKinnon’s sales grew at a decent 9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. Its growth was slightly above the average industrials company and shows its offerings resonate with customers. Columbus McKinnon Quarterly Revenue Long-term growth is the most important, but within industrials, a half-decade historical view may miss new industry trends or demand cycles. Columbus McKinnon’s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its revenue was flat over the last two years. Columbus McKinnon Year-On-Year Revenue Growth Columbus McKinnon also reports its backlog, or the value of its outstanding orders that have not yet been executed or delivered. Columbus McKinnon’s backlog reached $341.6 million in the latest quarter and averaged 15.2% year-on-year growth over the last two years. Because this number is better than its revenue growth, we can see the company accumulated more orders than it could fulfill and deferred revenue to the future. This could imply elevated demand for Columbus McKinnon’s products and services but raises concerns about capacity constraints. Story continues Columbus McKinnon Backlog This quarter, Columbus McKinnon reported year-on-year revenue growth of 10.5%, and its $258.7 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 5.3%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3% over the next 12 months. Although this projection indicates its newer products and services will catalyze better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average. The 1999 book Gorilla Game predicted Microsoft and Apple would dominate tech before it happened. Its thesis? Identify the platform winners early. Today, enterprise software companies embedding generative AI are becoming the new gorillas. a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next . Operating Margin Operating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after procuring and manufacturing its products, marketing and selling those products, and most importantly, keeping them relevant through research and development. Columbus McKinnon has done a decent job managing its cost base over the last five years. The company has produced an average operating margin of 9.1%, higher than the broader industrials sector. Analyzing the trend in its profitability, Columbus McKinnon’s operating margin decreased by 1.9 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company’s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Columbus McKinnon Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) This quarter, Columbus McKinnon generated an operating margin profit margin of 6.3%, down 4.7 percentage points year on year. Since Columbus McKinnon’s operating margin decreased more than its gross margin, we can assume it was less efficient because expenses such as marketing, R&D, and administrative overhead increased. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. Columbus McKinnon’s EPS grew at a remarkable 13.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 9% annualized revenue growth. However, we take this with a grain of salt because its operating margin didn’t improve and it didn’t repurchase its shares, meaning the delta came from reduced interest expenses or taxes. Columbus McKinnon Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business. Columbus McKinnon’s two-year annual EPS declines of 10.5% were bad and lower than its flat revenue. Diving into the nuances of Columbus McKinnon’s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. Columbus McKinnon’s operating margin has declined over the last two years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don’t tell us as much about a company’s fundamentals. In Q4, Columbus McKinnon reported adjusted EPS of $0.62, up from $0.56 in the same quarter last year. This print beat analysts’ estimates by 6.6%. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Columbus McKinnon’s full-year EPS of $2.34 to grow 18.1%. Key Takeaways from Columbus McKinnon’s Q4 Results We were impressed by how significantly Columbus McKinnon blew past analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also excited its revenue outperformed Wall Street’s estimates by a wide margin. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock remained flat at $23.11 immediately following the results. Indeed, Columbus McKinnon had a rock-solid quarterly earnings result, but is this stock a good investment here? If you’re making that decision, you should consider the bigger picture of valuation, business qualities, as well as the latest earnings.

Company Overview Formed through the 2013 merger of Elance and oDesk, Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) is an online platform where businesses and independent professionals connect to get work done. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Regrettably, Upwork’s sales grew at a mediocre 8.4% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years. This wasn’t a great result compared to the rest of the consumer internet sector, but there are still things to like about Upwork. Upwork Quarterly Revenue This quarter, Upwork grew its revenue by 3.6% year on year, and its $198.4 million of revenue was in line with Wall Street’s estimates. Company management is currently guiding for flat sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 6.4% over the next 12 months, a slight deceleration versus the last three years. This projection doesn't excite us and suggests its products and services will face some demand challenges. At least the company is tracking well in other measures of financial health. Story Continues Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming. Click here to access a free report on our 3 favorite stocks to play this generational megatrend . Gross Services Volume Customer Growth As a gig economy marketplace, Upwork generates revenue growth by expanding the number of services on its platform (e.g. rides, deliveries, freelance jobs) and raising the commission fee from each service provided. Upwork struggled with new customer acquisition over the last two years as its gross services volume have declined by 2.1% annually to 785,000 in the latest quarter. This performance isn't ideal because internet usage is secular, meaning there are typically unaddressed market opportunities. If Upwork wants to accelerate growth, it likely needs to enhance the appeal of its current offerings or innovate with new products. Upwork Gross Services Volume In Q4, Upwork’s gross services volume once again decreased by 47,000, a 5.6% drop since last year. The quarterly print was lower than its two-year result, suggesting its new initiatives aren’t moving the needle for customers yet. Revenue Per Customer Average revenue per customer (ARPC) is a critical metric to track because it measures how much the company earns in transaction fees from each customer. This number also informs us about Upwork’s take rate, which represents its pricing leverage over the ecosystem, or ""cut"" from each transaction. Upwork’s ARPC growth has been excellent over the last two years, averaging 9.5%. Although its gross services volume shrank during this time, the company’s ability to successfully increase monetization demonstrates its platform’s value for existing customers. Upwork ARPC This quarter, Upwork’s ARPC clocked in at $252.75. It grew by 9.8% year on year, faster than its gross services volume. Key Takeaways from Upwork’s Q4 Results It was encouraging to see Upwork beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also glad its full-year EBITDA guidance slightly exceeded Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its number of customers declined and its revenue guidance for next quarter fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a weaker quarter.

Its growth beat the average insurance company and shows its offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point for our analysis. Cincinnati Financial Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within financials, a half-decade historical view may miss recent interest rate changes, market returns, and industry trends. Cincinnati Financial’s annualized revenue growth of 13.1% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated. Cincinnati Financial Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Cincinnati Financial reported year-on-year revenue growth of 16.5%, and its $3.09 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 5.8%. Net premiums earned made up 89.2% of the company’s total revenue during the last five years, meaning Cincinnati Financial barely relies on non-insurance activities to drive its overall growth. Story Continues Cincinnati Financial Quarterly Net Premiums Earned as % of Revenue Net premiums earned commands greater market attention due to its reliability and consistency, whereas investment and fee income are often seen as more volatile revenue streams that fluctuate with market conditions. Software is eating the world and there is virtually no industry left that has been untouched by it. That drives increasing demand for tools helping software developers do their jobs, whether it be monitoring critical cloud infrastructure, integrating audio and video functionality, or ensuring smooth content streaming.

Book Value Per Share (BVPS) Insurers are balance sheet businesses, collecting premiums upfront and paying out claims over time. Premiums collected but not yet paid out, often referred to as the float, are invested and create an asset base supported by a liability structure. Book value per share (BVPS) captures this dynamic by measuring these assets (investment portfolio, cash, reinsurance recoverables) less liabilities (claim reserves, debt, future policy benefits). BVPS is essentially the residual value for shareholders. We therefore consider BVPS very important to track for insurers and a metric that sheds light on business quality because it reflects long-term capital growth and is harder to manipulate than more commonly-used metrics like EPS. Cincinnati Financial’s BVPS grew at a decent 8.8% annual clip over the last five years. BVPS growth has accelerated recently, growing by 15.2% annually over the last two years from $77.06 to $102.35 per share. Cincinnati Financial Quarterly Book Value per Share Over the next 12 months, Consensus estimates call for Cincinnati Financial’s BVPS to grow by 2.9% to $100.27, lousy growth rate. Key Takeaways from Cincinnati Financial’s Q4 Results We were impressed by how significantly Cincinnati Financial blew past analysts’ revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. Zooming out, we think this was a solid print. The stock remained flat at $168.67 immediately following the results. Should you buy the stock or not? We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it’s free . View Comments"

Money managers and analysts are now assessing which firms can best navigate the squeeze by locking in supplies, raising product prices or redesigning to use less memory.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/memory-chip-crunch-ripples-markets-023002147.html,"In this article: NTDOF AAPL SSNLF (Bloomberg) -- The relentless surge in memory chip prices over the past few months has driven a vast divide between winners and losers in the stock market, and investors don’t see any end in sight. Companies from game console maker Nintendo Co. to big PC brands and Apple Inc. suppliers are seeing shares slump on profitability concerns. Memory producers, meanwhile, are soaring to unprecedented heights. Money managers and analysts are now assessing which firms can best navigate the squeeze by locking in supplies, raising product prices or redesigning to use less memory. Most Read from Bloomberg NJ Transit Service Between Trenton and New York City Resumes Canadian Province New Brunswick to Quit Using Elon Musk’s X For These Old Bus Stations, It’s Not the End of the Line A Bloomberg gauge of global consumer electronics makers is down 10% since the end of September while a basket of memory makers including Samsung Electronics Co. has surged roughly 160%. The question now is how much is priced in. “What remains underappreciated is the risk around duration — current valuations largely factor in that the disruption will normalize within one to two quarters,” said Vivian Pai, a fund manager at Fidelity International. “We believe industry tightness is likely to persist,” possibly through the rest of the year, she added. Memory chip shortages and pricing are being mentioned frequently by companies in earnings reports and conference calls. In one of the latest examples, Honda Motor Co. noted Tuesday that supply risks are emerging for memory components. Investors are hearing the alarm bells. Shares of Qualcomm Inc. fell more than 8% last Thursday after the smartphone processor maker signaled memory constraints will limit phone production. Nintendo slid the most in 18 months in Tokyo the day after it warned of margin pressure from the shortages. Swiss peripherals maker Logitech International SA has seen its stock slide around 30% from a November peak as higher chip prices damp the outlook for PC demand. Shares of Chinese electric vehicle and smartphone makers from BYD Co. to Xiaomi Corp. have also been sluggish on worry related to the chip shortages. “Memory prices have really moved from a background conversation to headlines this earnings season,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo. “The market broadly understands that memory prices are up and supply is tight — that’s no longer new information, so I would assume that’s priced in. But it does look like the timeline of this supply tightness is now starting to be questioned.” Story Continues Memory ‘Supercycle’ Concerns over demand and earnings are weighing on the corporate landscape, compounded by worries that massive AI infrastructure spending by US hyperscalers will further exacerbate memory-chip shortages. The massive build‑out of AI infrastructure led by the likes of Amazon.com Inc. has shifted production capacity toward high-bandwidth memory and away from traditional DRAM. This has led to what some are describing as a “supercycle,” breaking the usual boom-to-bust patterns of memory supply and demand. Spot prices for DRAM have shot up more than 600% in the past few months, even as demand for end-products like smartphones and cars remains weak. On top of that, AI is creating new demand for NAND chips and other storage products, driving up costs in those segments as well. As such, memory chip makers have been the standout winners among tech stocks. Shares of SK Hynix Inc., a key supplier of HBM to Nvidia Corp., are up more than 150% just since the end of September in Seoul. Among makers of more pedestrian chips, Japan’s Kioxia Holdings Corp. and Taiwan’s Nanya Technology Corp. are up over 270% each in that span, while Sandisk Corp. has climbed more than 400% in New York. “Historically the memory cycle normally lasted 3-4 years,” said Jian Shi Cortesi, a fund manager at GAM Investment Management in Zurich, adding that she has been holding memory chip shares for a long time. “The current cycle already exceeded the previous cycles both in length and magnitude, and we are not seeing demand momentum softening.” Top Tech Stories Alphabet Inc. is borrowing far and wide to finance the unprecedented spending plan behind its artificial intelligence ambitions, and investors can’t seem to get enough. Criminals in Southeast Asia are harnessing inexpensive AI tools to target bigger pools of potential victims at high speed, keeping scam centers humming even as governments try and crack down, senior officials at Interpol say. Australia’s digital regulator said it’s testing Roblox Corp.’s compliance with its own commitments to keep kids safe as concerns grow about potential child grooming and sexual exploitation on the platform. --With assistance from Henry Ren, Vlad Savov and Neil Campling.

2026-02-10 10:00:23,"Only the bond markets still believe in Starmer As Prime Minister Keir Starmer keeps tally on which senior Labour figures have come out for and against him, he can take solace from at least one unlikely source.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/only-bond-markets-still-believe-063000015.html,"Bond markets react negatively when Sir Keir’s leadership is challenged - James Manning/WPA Pool As Prime Minister Keir Starmer keeps tally on which senior Labour figures have come out for and against him, he can take solace from at least one unlikely source. Every time leadership speculation has ignited, the UK bond market has taken fright. When it looked like Manchester mayor Andy Burnham might run for a House of Commons seat, gilt yields jumped. As the body count of staffers rose in Downing Street on Monday, yields climbed too. Traders were reacting to these threats to Starmer by selling government bonds. This pushes up the bonds’ yields – how much interest the Government owes the borrower – and thus also the Chancellor’s borrowing costs. Investors fear that Sir Keir’s exit might invite political chaos, a power vacuum or Left-wing fiscal profligacy. Or all of the above. And their skittish behaviour serves to protect him from his foes. “The only thing saving Keir Starmer right now is the bond market. The market is possibly his best friend,” one veteran City broker says. It’s a powerful friend to have. James Carville , once a top aide to US president Bill Clinton, offered what is now the most famous encapsulation of the bond vigilantes’ icy grip on politicians, particularly of the Left. “I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope, or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.” That power has only strengthened since then, particularly in the UK where debt levels have ballooned and even minor moves in bond prices can have profound implications for public finances. But sometimes, as said in a quote often attributed to German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, “friendship closes its eyes”. While bond investors are backing Starmer, the market seems to be underestimating the risk of his downfall. The City is nervous, but it seems far less alive to the risk of Sir Keir’s fall than Westminster. Polymarket, an online prediction market used by the public, now puts the odds of Sir Keir surviving the year as leader at just 25pc, down from 50pc a week ago. They offer a 23pc probability that he could be gone by the end of this month. Bond pricing, by contrast, is moving in inches. To be sure, the yield on the UK 10-year government bond is hovering at around highs seldom seen since the 2008 financial crisis. It is much higher than it would be if the bond’s yield were simply moving more or less in concert with the Bank of England’s benchmark interest rate. But although the bond market is alert, it is not yet alarmed. Leer más Traders simply aren’t moving to price these risks into gilts as hard or as fast as the rival Labour factions are moving on Downing Street. In theory, the gilt market should adjust prices and yields in tandem with every increase in political risk. “But that’s not what happens,” David Lubin, a former bank economist now at the think tank Chatham House, says. “The market ignores increases in risk until it stops ignoring them. And then when it stops ignoring them, you get a straight-line [vertical] increase in yield.” One City veteran describes the bond market as still moving through the classic cycle of ‘the three Cs’: complacency, concern, then capitulation. b' ' It is easy to see why investors might be complacent. Ousting a Labour leader is procedurally and politically difficult. And this particular one has made all the right noises about economic growth and fiscal rectitude. It is reassuring to think he will survive. But for many in Westminster, it is a question of when, not if, the Prime Minister goes. The third C – the market’s capitulation to what is, by then, the inevitable – is difficult to predict. “A government is fiscally prudent and has got the bond market on side until suddenly it hasn’t,” says Paul Dales, of Capital Economics. “Often, actually, it’s not an economic trigger. It’s usually a political trigger or a vibe trigger.” Lubin compares the bond market to a herd of deer, which will move as one when startled. “Traders in any market are constantly looking over their shoulder to see what their competitors are doing. And herds move in unpredictable ways, but when they move, the movement generates a lot of activity and encourages a lot of people to follow the herd.” Or, as a City trader puts it: “If you’re going to panic, panic properly. Panic when everyone else is panicking.” The markets have form when it comes to being blindsided and then stampeding. After the vote for Brexit in 2016, a frenzied sell-off sent the pound to a three-decade low. At that time, government debt was relatively benign and interest rates were near zero. This meant the bond market was less ruffled by the referendum than sterling. That is not the case today, warns Jagjit Chadha, a Cambridge University economics professor. “Here’s an economy that’s vulnerable . Here’s a country that has to borrow, net, from abroad. And here’s a country that hasn’t really got the fiscal situation under control,” he says. Liz Truss sent the bond yield spiralling, not because she planned to borrow, but because her plan was potentially inflationary and underfunded. Sir Keir and Rachel Reeves, his Chancellor, have tried to regain the markets’ trust and confidence with their fiscal rule, which requires debt to be falling as a percentage of GDP by 2029. But trust can be a fickle thing. The market may be helping Sir Keir ward off his challengers, but Chadha reckons it is not especially enamoured of his premiership. He says bond traders know that Reeves’s fiscal rules, which are supposed to offer reassurance to the markets, are “arbitrary”. The amount of so-called fiscal headroom in the Government’s books can shift any time, if the Office for Budget Responsibility changes its forecast. The market’s even deeper concern, he says, is “where we might go, what are the alternatives”. Investors fear that whoever replaces Starmer will be more free-spending and less concerned with the state of public finances. Or, as Andy Burnham famously put it, not “in hock to the bond markets” . If that were to come to pass, expect markets to react violently. “The current economic and fiscal situation is already primed for being ignited, and you just need to throw a little petrol on it, or a match on it, and then it goes,” says Dales. For now, Sir Keir has the bond market on his side. Until suddenly, one day, he doesn’t. And even if the vigilante herd isn’t moving yet, he will be brutally exposed when they do.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. recommended that investors buy the stocks of AI intelligence model developers MiniMax Group Inc. ( 0100.HK ) and Knowledge Atlas Technology JSC Ltd. ( 2513.HK ), also known as Zhipu. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rated chip designers Shanghai Biren Technology Co. and MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai Co. ( 688802.SS ) as new buys, on the strong AI growth outlook. The shares of MiniMax and Zhipu jumped on Tuesday. MetaX rose as well, while Biren pared Monday’s gains. Most Read from Bloomberg NJ Transit Service Between Trenton and New York City Resumes Canadian Province New Brunswick to Quit Using Elon Musk’s X For These Old Bus Stations, It’s Not the End of the Line A crop of new star companies is emerging from the boom in Chinese technology, spurred by the competition with the US and accelerated by DeepSeek’s breakthrough a year ago. The stellar debut of chip designer Montage Technology Co. on Monday showed that investor demand for the industry remains strong, even after sentiment has wobbled around global technology shares. Shares of Knowledge Atlas, also known as Zhipu, climbed as much as 24% to a record high and MiniMax’s gained as much as 11% after JPMorgan analysts including Olivia Xu initiated coverage of the pair at overweight. Both went public last month — along with Biren, with Metax’s listing in December — taking advantage of the strong AI tailwind in Hong Kong’s stock market. MiniMax has soared about 230% in a little over a month while Zhipu has jumped more than 170%. The two companies are “top picks to capture the next wave of global AI value creation,” JPMorgan’s analysts wrote in a note. “We believe MiniMax and Zhipu stand out as the two most distinctive independent large language model developers with accelerating global footprints.” MiniMax, which generates most of its sales abroad, will see revenue grow at a compound annual rate of 138% through 2030, according to JPMorgan. The analysts project Zhipu’s sales growth at 127% over the same period, and say both companies should turn profitable in 2029. Goldman Sachs strategists labeled Biren and MetaX a “local GPU leader” as they initiated coverage, and expected both firms to benefit from China’s rising cloud spending and the government’s support for local AI chips.

2026-02-10 10:00:29,Tem raises $75M to remake electricity markets using AI Tem has built a transaction engine that relies on AI to cut costs. Lightspeed led the round to help the startup expand to the U.S. and Australia.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tem-raises-75m-remake-electricity-030100765.html,"In this article: ALIZF Image Credits:ArtisticPhoto / Shutterstock As AI data centers drive up electricity prices , London-based startup Tem thinks AI might be able to help solve it, too. Tem has built an energy transaction engine that relies on AI to cut prices relative to other energy traders. The company has signed up more than 2,600 business customers throughout the U.K. on the promise that buying energy from its utility division can save them up to 30% on their energy bills. The startup recently closed an oversubscribed $75 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners with participation from AlbionVC, Allianz, Atomico, Hitachi Ventures, Revent, Schroders Capital, and Voyager Ventures, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The round values Tem at more than $300 million, a source familiar with the deal told TechCrunch. The startup plans to use the funding to help expand to Australia and the U.S., starting with Texas. “We’re in a nice position where we kind of have control over our own profitability. So I could have chosen not to raise at all and had a lovely, nice bootstrap business in some ways,” Joe McDonald, co-founder and CEO of Tem, told TechCrunch. “Well, we’re not that kind of business. We know what we want to achieve as someone who wants to go public over the years.” Tem is a classic marketplace play, matching electricity generators with consumers. The company intentionally started by focusing almost exclusively on renewable energy generators and small businesses to fill both sides of the ledger. “The more decentralized and the more distributed, the better it is for the algorithms,” McDonald said. “But this works all the way up to enterprise.” The company’s customers include fast-fashion retailer Boohoo Group, soft drink company Fever-Tree, and Newcastle United FC. Currently, Tem is running what amounts to two different businesses. One, called Rosso, is the transaction engine that matches suppliers with buyers. Here, machine learning algorithms and LLMs help predict supply and demand. The goal with Rosso, McDonald said, is to cut costs by eliminating several layers that are present in current energy markets. “In each of them, you’ve got different teams doing different jobs, taking different levels of profit from back office to trading, trading desks to other trading desks, and probably five to six intermediaries in total that enable the flow of money to move from one side to the other,” he said. With AI, he said, “you now have an opportunity to replace the humans, the labor costs, and the disparate systems into one single transaction infrastructure.” The goal is to make the price that customers pay for electricity closer to the wholesale cost. Story Continues The other part of Tem, called RED, is a “neo-utility” built to prove the value of Rosso. “When we first started, we tried to sell our infrastructure to the energy companies, and we got nowhere,” he said. RED is currently the only utility using Rosso, and McDonald said its growth has pushed the company to prioritize it over opening Rosso to others. At some point, though, Tem plans to allow other utilities in. “In reality, it doesn’t matter how good [RED] is; it’s not going to get above a 40% market share. And it shouldn’t, because that becomes a monopoly in itself. So, me, I’d much rather go to get access to all the transaction flow,” McDonald said. “Long term, we really don’t mind who owns the customer, who owns the generation as long as our infrastructure is being used,” he said. “This is just an infrastructure play in the same way AWS was, or Stripe was.” View Comments"

Robinhood is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday, with traders anticipating a big swing from the retail brokerage's stock following the results. Current options pricing suggests traders expect Robinhood ( HOOD ) stock could swing around 9% in either direction by the end of the week. A move of that size from Monday's close near $87 could lift the stock back up to $95, where it was before taking a hit last week, or send it down to $78.

It's a win-win for both Palantir and its clients, with one shipbuilder slashing their planning time from 160 hours to 10 minutes. A boost like that makes up for very sticky customer relationships and opens the door for further deals. Moreover, adjusted free cash flow for Q4 hit $791 million at a 56% margin. For the full year, the metric reached $2.27 billion at a 51% margin. These figures are truly unbelievable, even for a software company. Why the Market Is Still Saying No to PLTR Stock Palantir's valuation is mostly where things start going awry. The company has a spotless track record, but Wall Street is no longer willing to pay a massive premium for it. That may have a lot to do with the broader market entering a ""risk-off"" mode by dumping speculative assets and piling into safer ones. Story Continues Take a look at the S&P 500 Software & Services Select Industry Index (XSW), for example. www.barchart.com A business like Palantir won't buck the trend this time because the stock was already overdue for a correction. If anything, the selloff in Palantir is a healthy reset that will allow the fundamentals to catch up to the sky-high valuation. Is PLTR Stock a Buy Now? Even though PLTR stock is down 31% from its 52-week high, it remains uncomfortably expensive. PLTR stock trades at 123 times forward earnings and roughly 90 times next year's earnings. Palantir's management tends to lowball estimates, so you can assume that you're realistically paying a little less than that, but those figures remain above the norm. Remember, the rest of the software sector is taking a dive, and investors are paying just 24 times earnings for a stock like Nvidia (NVDA). Comparing Palantir's valuation to last year looks cheap, but it's still exceptionally high against its historical valuation and peers. Forward-looking investors will realize that investors are getting pickier as AI novelty wears off. You should no longer expect Palantir to trade at 2025 premiums. Analyst sentiment remains genuinely divided. And for the first time, Wall Street has done the exact opposite of what it would have done after such an earnings beat. www.barchart.com In my opinion, investors should take some time to digest these ominous signs and only accumulate software stocks that are trading at a bargain. If the sector keeps bleeding, the floor is a lot lower for PLTR stock. Compare that to something like Microsoft (MSFT), and you'll notice that the herd will ramp up the buying pressure the moment it drops below 20 times forward earnings. PLTR stock will need to drop further before anyone calls it a bargain.

2026-02-10 10:00:38,"Amid Capex Concerns, Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold Alphabet Stock? Alphabet's aggressive investment in AI is already translating into tangible business momentum.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amid-capex-concerns-buy-sell-215821403.html,"In this article: GOOG Alphabet (GOOGL) recently posted robust fourth-quarter and full-year results, with its annual revenue surpassing the $400 billion mark for the first time in its history. Growth accelerated across Alphabet’s core businesses, driven largely by artificial intelligence (AI)-led capabilities, while its backlog expanded meaningfully. While its strong Q4 performance should have propelled the stock higher, Alphabet’s share price instead lost steam. The primary reason is due to investor concern over capital expenditures (capex). As Alphabet continues to deepen its AI capabilities and scale infrastructure to meet rising demand, management has guided for a substantial increase in spending. Capex is expected to reach between $175 billion and $185 billion in 2026, nearly double the $91.5 billion invested in 2025, with spending set to ramp up as the year progresses. More News from Barchart The Shocking Reason This Analyst Says Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy Stock Will Take Bitcoin Prices to $0 Is the Market Running on Borrowed Time?

Subscribe today! Higher capex will drive faster depreciation growth, beginning in the first quarter of 2026 and increasing meaningfully over the full year. As a result, free cash flow is likely to come under pressure, creating a headwind that the market is already factoring into the stock’s valuation. The muted reaction post Alphabet’s solid Q4 results suggests that investors were not comfortable with the scale of the spending increase. However, this pushback does not undermine the long-term investment thesis. The elevated capex is due to Alphabet’s strategy to defend and expand its leadership in AI, cloud computing, and digital advertising, areas that continue to show strong demand and long-term growth potential. While the near-term impact on free cash flow may weigh on sentiment, Alphabet’s underlying business strength, accelerating growth, and strategic positioning in AI support its investment case. www.barchart.com Alphabet to Sustain Strong Growth in 2026 Alphabet has faced investor skepticism about its high capex guidance for 2026. Yet, the company’s latest results and outlook suggest GOOGL stock remains a compelling investment. Its aggressive investment in AI is already translating into tangible business momentum. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Alphabet delivered robust financial performance, with consolidated revenue rising 18% year-over-year (YOY) to $113.8 billion. Growth was broad-based, led by acceleration in Search and Google Cloud. These results highlight AI as becoming a meaningful growth engine across Alphabet’s core businesses. Story Continues Google Services, which includes Search, YouTube, and subscriptions, generated $95.9 billion in revenue, up 14% from the prior year. Search and other advertising revenues climbed 17% to $63.1 billion, reflecting stronger engagement and improved monetization driven by AI-powered enhancements. YouTube advertising revenue increased 9% to $11.4 billion, supported by solid direct-response advertising demand despite difficult YOY comparisons. Google Cloud once again delivered exceptional growth, with revenue surging 48% to $17.7 billion in the quarter. This acceleration was driven by strong enterprise demand for AI-related offerings, particularly within Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP continues to outperform the broader cloud business, benefiting from higher win rates with new customers, larger long-term customer commitments, and increased spending from existing clients. Enterprise AI products are now generating billions in quarterly revenue, reflecting their growing importance to Alphabet’s overall growth profile. This momentum is being driven by strength across both AI infrastructure and AI solutions. Demand for enterprise-grade infrastructure, including TPUs and GPUs, has been robust as customers scale AI workloads. At the same time, Alphabet’s proprietary models, including Gemini 3, are gaining traction across industries. Google Cloud’s backlog rose 55% sequentially and more than doubled YOY, reaching $240 billion by the end of the fourth quarter. This sharp increase reflects strong multi-year demand, led primarily by enterprise AI contracts from a diverse customer base. Looking ahead, Alphabet’s continued investment in AI compute capacity, even at the cost of higher near-term capex, positions the company for faster growth in 2026 and beyond. The rapidly expanding cloud backlog provides further confidence that revenue momentum is sustainable. Why Alphabet Stock is a Buy Alphabet is converting its AI investments into real revenue. Moreover, a $240 billion backlog and growing billion-dollar deals suggest that its AI strategy is gaining traction. Short-term free cash flow pressure may persist, but it does not outweigh the durability and scalability of Alphabet’s growth engine. Wall Street analysts also maintain a “Strong Buy” consensus rating on GOOGL despite concerns about capex. www.barchart.com On the date of publication, Amit Singh did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

2026-02-10 10:00:40,QuantumScape Just Broke Through Its 200-Day Moving Average. Should You Buy QS Stock Before Earnings?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantumscape-just-broke-200-day-214717294.html,"In this article: QS VLKAF QuantumScape (QS) shares pushed meaningfully higher on Monday after the battery technology company officially launched its much-awaited production-scale platform, Eagle Line. Following the rally on Feb. 9, QS looks headed to challenge its 200-day moving average (MA), a key resistance point. Breaking above this level often accelerates bullish momentum in the near term. More News from Barchart The Shocking Reason This Analyst Says Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy Stock Will Take Bitcoin Prices to $0 Is the Market Running on Borrowed Time?

Subscribe now for quick, incisive midday market analysis you won't find anywhere else. Despite the surge, however, QuantumScape stock remains down some 20% versus its year-to-date high. www.barchart.com Does Eagle Line Warrant Buying QuantumScape Stock? For years, the bear case hinged on whether California-based QuantumScape can manufacture its solid-state chemistry at scale. The Eagle Line proves industrial viability by validating the high-speed “Cobra” process, showing the tech is much more than just a lab experiment. Additionally, it creates the blueprint for licensing deals, enabling partners like Volkswagen (VWAGY) to fund and build massive factories. The Eagle Line produces B-samples needed for final automotive testing, bringing actual vehicle integration closer than ever. In short, the production-scale platform warrants buying QS stock as it marks the firm’s transition from “lab” to “line,” positioning it to begin realizing commercial revenue in 2026. Are QS Shares Worth Buying Heading into Q4 Earnings? Risk-tolerant investors should consider investing in QuantumScape shares for shrinking losses as well. The Nasdaq-listed firm is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter (Q4) results on Tuesday, Feb. 11. Consensus is for it to report $0.16 a share of loss, much narrower than the $0.22 loss per share a year ago. QS’s recent announcement of a joint development agreement (JDA) with another top 10 automaker, expanding its customer base beyond VW, makes up for another great reason to own it for the long term. How Wall Street Recommends Playing QuantumScape Despite the Eagle Line announcement, however, Wall Street remains bearish on QuantumScape. The consensus rating on QS shares sits at “Moderate Sell” with the mean target of $9.55 indicating shares are unlikely to push meaningfully higher from here, at least in the near term. www.barchart.com This article was created with the support of automated content tools from our partners at Sigma.AI.

The company reported $2 million in net income in the quarter, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The number is a significant improvement from when it lost $52 million the same time in 2024, and means the company ended 2025 with a full-year net income of $23 million, the first time it has been profitable since 2012. Revenue rose 18 percent to $654 million, while Adjusted EBITDA was up to $149 million from $112 million in 2024. The company’s for-sale business recorded quarterly revenue of $475 million, up 11 percent annually, and Mortgages revenue increased 39 percent year over year to $57 million. Traffic to Zillow’s site was up 8 percent annually to 221 million average monthly unique users, and visits were roughly flat at 2.1 billion. Its growth came in the face of a flat year for the housing market , which saw 3 percent growth, according to the National Association of Realtors. “Our results show we’re executing a clear strategy, gaining share across for sale and rentals and building a platform designed for durable growth across market conditions,” Zillow Jeremy Wacksman said on the call. Financials > lawsuits The strong financial results are a positive end note on what has otherwise been a tumultuous year for Zillow, in which it has faced down lawsuits from competitors like Compass and CoStar, as well as lawmakers at the Federal Trade Commission. In June, Compass sued Zillow over its policy that threatened to ban listings from its platform if they were not uploaded to the MLS and Zillow within 24 hours of public marketing. Last week, a judge denied Compass’ request to temporarily halt the policy while the case proceeds. One month later, CoStar sued Zillow over its alleged copyright infringement of thousands of photos used on rental listings, and in September, the FTC claimed that Zillow and Redfin colluded in their $100 million agreement to syndicate rental listings. Wacksman brushed aside potential concerns about the lawsuits during the call, briefly noting “we are confident in our positions and approach.” Both those lawsuits, which are still pending, strike at what has been one of Zillow’s fastest-growing segments in its rentals business. Zillow reported its rentals business grew revenue 45 percent annually to $168 million in the fourth quarter. “We see a clear path to a billion-dollar-plus annual revenue opportunity,” Wacksman said of its rentals business, which he said increased its estimated market share to 63 percent in 2025 from 54 percent the previous year.

The first quarter revenue outlook, however, fell short. Chegg said it expects revenue between $60 million and $62 million, whereas the Street was looking for $64 million in revenue. Last October, Chegg announced mass layoffs and an aggressive pivot to reskilling as the company looks to withstand greater competition from OpenAI's ( OPAI.PVT ) Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ). The two companies have rolled out new study tools for their AI chatbots, ChatGPT and Gemini, and Chegg has also sued Google over its AI-generated search summaries, which have hurt traffic. “We are reinventing Chegg around the $40 billion skilling market, which we believe can drive double-digit growth with strong margins and cash flow in the years to come,” Chegg CEO Dan Rosensweig said in the Q4 earnings release. “We’ve organized the company into two focused businesses: Chegg Skilling as our growth engine and our legacy Academic Services, which generates free cash flow that strengthens our balance sheet and positions us to end 2026 debt-free with a substantial cash balance.” Chegg stock fell 5% in extended trading.

The steel producer recorded a net loss per share of $0.44, which was narrower than the $0.60 loss Wall Street was expecting, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $4.3 billion fell short of estimates of $4.5 billion. Cleveland-Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves cited weakness in the auto sector, a ""value-destructive"" slab contract, and a negative situation in the Canadian market as reasons for the revenue miss. “Our performance in 2025 was negatively affected by persistently weak production levels from the automotive sector throughout the entire year, an expiring five-year slab contract becoming value-destructive during its last year, and a newly adverse dynamic in the Canadian market,"" Goncalves said in a statement. ""Fortunately, as we started 2026, these negative situations have all improved."" In the fourth quarter, Cleveland-Cliffs had 3.77 million net tons in steel shipments, compared to 3.8 million tons in the same period a year earlier.

Angi (ANGI) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $240.8 million vs analyst estimates of $243.7 million (10.1% year-on-year decline, 1.2% miss) EPS (GAAP): $0.17 vs analyst expectations of $0.34 (50.2% miss) Adjusted EBITDA: $39.7 million vs analyst estimates of $40.05 million (16.5% margin, 0.9% miss) Operating Margin: 2.5%, up from 0.8% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 4.7%, up from 1.9% in the previous quarter Market Capitalization: $504.4 million Company Overview Created by IAC’s mergers of Angie’s List and HomeAdvisor, ANGI (NASDAQ: ANGI) operates the largest online marketplace for home services in the US. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last three years, Angi’s demand was weak and its revenue declined by 17.9% per year. This wasn’t a great result and is a rough starting point for our analysis. Angi Quarterly Revenue This quarter, Angi missed Wall Street’s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 10.1% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $240.8 million of revenue. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.8% over the next 12 months. While this projection implies its newer products and services will fuel better top-line performance, it is still below the sector average.

Click here to access our free report one of our favorites growth stories . Cash Is King Although EBITDA is undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can’t use accounting profits to pay the bills. Angi has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company’s free cash flow margin averaged 6.8% over the last two years, slightly better than the broader consumer internet sector. Taking a step back, we can see that Angi’s margin expanded by 9.2 percentage points over the last few years. This is encouraging because it gives the company more optionality. Angi Trailing 12-Month Free Cash Flow Margin Angi’s free cash flow clocked in at $11.4 million in Q4, equivalent to a 4.7% margin. The company’s cash profitability regressed as it was 5.4 percentage points lower than in the same quarter last year, prompting us to pay closer attention. Short-term fluctuations typically aren’t a big deal because investment needs can be seasonal, but we’ll be watching to see if the trend extrapolates into future quarters. Story Continues Key Takeaways from Angi’s Q4 Results We struggled to find many positives in these results. Its revenue slightly missed and its EBITDA fell slightly short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 8.7% to $10.92 immediately after reporting. The latest quarter from Angi’s wasn’t that good. One earnings report doesn’t define a company’s quality, though, so let’s explore whether the stock is a buy at the current price. We think that the latest quarter is just one piece of the longer-term business quality puzzle. Quality, when combined with valuation, can help determine if the stock is a buy.

Revenue Growth Reviewing a company’s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can experience short-term success, but top-performing ones enjoy sustained growth for years. Zillow’s demand was weak over the last five years as its sales fell at a 5% annual rate. This wasn’t a great result and suggests it’s a low quality business. Zillow Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within consumer discretionary, a stretched historical view may miss a company riding a successful new product or trend. Zillow’s annualized revenue growth of 15.2% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, but we were still disappointed by the results. Zillow Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Zillow reported year-on-year revenue growth of 18.1%, and its $654 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 0.5%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 14.5% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection is above average for the sector and implies its newer products and services will help sustain its recent top-line performance.

Operating Margin Zillow’s operating margin has been trending up over the last 12 months, but it still averaged negative 4.8% over the last two years. This is due to its large expense base and inefficient cost structure. Story Continues Zillow Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, Zillow generated a negative 1.7% operating margin. The company's consistent lack of profits raise a flag. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. Zillow’s full-year EPS flipped from negative to positive over the last five years. This is encouraging and shows it’s at a critical moment in its life. Zillow Trailing 12-Month EPS (GAAP) In Q4, Zillow reported EPS of $0.01, up from negative $0.20 in the same quarter last year.

Over the last five years, Pegasystems grew its sales at a 11.4% annual rate. Although this growth is acceptable on an absolute basis, it fell short of our standards for the software sector, which enjoys a number of secular tailwinds. Pegasystems Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within software, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Pegasystems’s recent performance shows its demand has slowed as its annualized revenue growth of 10.4% over the last two years was below its five-year trend. Pegasystems Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Pegasystems reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 2.7% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 2.6%. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 5.9% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years.

We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Story Continues Annual Contract Value While reported revenue for a SaaS business can include a range of one-time items like implementation fees, annual contract value (ACV) only considers contracted revenue, usually from recurring software subscriptions. This is the high-margin, predictable revenue stream that makes SaaS businesses so valuable. Pegasystems’s ACV punched in at $1.61 billion in Q4, and over the last four quarters, its growth was solid as it averaged 17.2% year-on-year increases. This performance aligned with its total sales growth, reflecting the company’s ability to upsell its customers and maintain strong long-term relationships. Its growth also contributes positively to Pegasystems’s predictability and valuation, as investors typically prefer businesses with recurring revenue. Pegasystems Annual Contract Value Customer Acquisition Efficiency The customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period measures the months a company needs to recoup the money spent on acquiring a new customer. This metric helps assess how quickly a business can break even on its sales and marketing investments. Pegasystems’s recent customer acquisition efforts haven’t yielded returns as its CAC payback period was negative this quarter, meaning its incremental sales and marketing investments outpaced its revenue. The company’s inefficiency indicates it operates in a competitive market and must continue investing to grow. Key Takeaways from Pegasystems’s Q4 Results We were impressed by Pegasystems’s optimistic full-year EPS guidance, which blew past analysts’ expectations. We were also glad its full-year revenue guidance trumped Wall Street’s estimates. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The market seemed to be hoping for more, and the stock traded down 5.9% to $40.51 immediately after reporting. So should you invest in Pegasystems right now?

Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Teradata’s demand was weak over the last five years as its sales fell at a 2% annual rate. This wasn’t a great result and suggests it’s a low quality business. Teradata Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within software, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Teradata’s recent performance shows its demand remained suppressed as its revenue has declined by 4.8% annually over the last two years. Teradata Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Teradata reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 2.9% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 5.4%. Company management is currently guiding for a 2% year-on-year increase in sales next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 1.8% over the next 12 months. While this projection is better than its two-year trend, it’s hard to get excited about a company that is struggling with demand. Story Continues Microsoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend. We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Annual Recurring Revenue While reported revenue for a software company can include low-margin items like implementation fees, annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a sum of the next 12 months of contracted revenue purely from software subscriptions, or the high-margin, predictable revenue streams that make SaaS businesses so valuable. Over the last year, Teradata failed to grow its ARR, which came in at $1.52 billion in the latest quarter. However, this alternate topline metric outperformed its total sales, which likely means that the recurring portions of the business are growing faster than less predictable, choppier ones such as implementation fees. That could be a good sign for future revenue growth. Teradata Annual Recurring Revenue Customer Acquisition Efficiency The customer acquisition cost (CAC) payback period represents the months required to recover the cost of acquiring a new customer. Essentially, it’s the break-even point for sales and marketing investments. A shorter CAC payback period is ideal, as it implies better returns on investment and business scalability. It’s relatively expensive for Teradata to acquire new customers as its CAC payback period checked in at 54.6 months this quarter. The company’s slow recovery of its sales and marketing expenses indicates it operates in a highly competitive market and must invest to stand out, even if the return on that investment is low. Key Takeaways from Teradata’s Q4 Results We were impressed by Teradata’s optimistic EPS guidance for next quarter, which blew past analysts’ expectations. We were also glad its full-year EPS guidance exceeded Wall Street’s estimates. As for the quarter, that was quite solid as well, with revenue and adjusted operating income beating expectations. Zooming out, we think this was a very good print with some key areas of upside. The stock traded up 14.2% to $33.40 immediately following the results. Teradata had an encouraging quarter, but one earnings result doesn’t necessarily make the stock a buy. Let’s see if this is a good investment. What happened in the latest quarter matters, but not as much as longer-term business quality and valuation, when deciding whether to invest in this stock.

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.15 per share was 7.8% below analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy Mirion? Find out in our full research report . Mirion (MIR) Q4 CY2025 Highlights: Revenue: $277.4 million vs analyst estimates of $281.2 million (9.1% year-on-year growth, 1.3% miss) Adjusted EPS: $0.15 vs analyst expectations of $0.16 (7.8% miss) Adjusted EBITDA: $77.6 million vs analyst estimates of $76.15 million (28% margin, 1.9% beat) Adjusted EPS guidance for the upcoming financial year 2026 is $0.53 at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 12.3% EBITDA guidance for the upcoming financial year 2026 is $292.5 million at the midpoint, in line with analyst expectations Operating Margin: 9.2%, down from 11.5% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 22.8%, up from 19.3% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $5.52 billion Company Overview With its technology protecting workers in over 130 countries and equipment used in 80% of cancer centers worldwide, Mirion Technologies (NYSE:MIR) provides radiation detection, measurement, and monitoring solutions for medical, nuclear energy, defense, and scientific research applications. Revenue Growth Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. With $925.4 million in revenue over the past 12 months, Mirion is a small player in the business services space, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and numerous distribution channels. On the bright side, it can grow faster because it has more room to expand. As you can see below, Mirion’s sales grew at an excellent 11.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This is an encouraging starting point for our analysis because it shows Mirion’s demand was higher than many business services companies. Mirion Quarterly Revenue We at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within business services, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. Mirion’s annualized revenue growth of 7.5% over the last two years is below its five-year trend, but we still think the results suggest healthy demand. Mirion Year-On-Year Revenue Growth This quarter, Mirion’s revenue grew by 9.1% year on year to $277.4 million, missing Wall Street’s estimates. Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 22.6% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is eye-popping and implies its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance. Story Continues Microsoft, Alphabet, Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage—all began as under-the-radar growth stories riding a massive trend. We’ve identified the next one: a profitable AI semiconductor play Wall Street is still overlooking. Go here for access to our full report . Operating Margin Mirion was roughly breakeven when averaging the last five years of quarterly operating profits, one of the worst outcomes in the business services sector. On the plus side, Mirion’s operating margin rose by 8.9 percentage points over the last five years, as its sales growth gave it operating leverage. Mirion Trailing 12-Month Operating Margin (GAAP) In Q4, Mirion generated an operating margin profit margin of 9.2%, down 2.3 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses grew faster than its revenue. Earnings Per Share Revenue trends explain a company’s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth – for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions. Mirion’s full-year EPS dropped 9.2%, or 3% annually, over the last three years. We’ll keep a close eye on the company as diminishing earnings could imply changing secular trends and preferences. Mirion Trailing 12-Month EPS (Non-GAAP) Like with revenue, we analyze EPS over a shorter period to see if we are missing a change in the business. For Mirion, its two-year annual EPS growth of 18.8% was higher than its three-year trend. This acceleration made it one of the faster-growing business services companies in recent history. In Q4, Mirion reported adjusted EPS of $0.15, down from $0.17 in the same quarter last year. This print missed analysts’ estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Mirion’s full-year EPS of $0.48 to grow 26.4%. Key Takeaways from Mirion’s Q4 Results We struggled to find many positives in these results. Its full-year EPS guidance missed and its EPS fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. Overall, this was a softer quarter. The stock traded down 6.7% to $21.86 immediately after reporting. Mirion underperformed this quarter, but does that create an opportunity to invest right now? When making that decision, it’s important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter.

But it was only the most recent example of a sell-first, ask-questions-later mentality that has rapidly taken hold as new products emerge from the hundreds of billions of dollars poured into AI, sowing anxiety about how the technology may upend entire industries. “Every company with any sort of potential disruption risk is getting sold indiscriminately,” said John Belton, a money manager at Gabelli Funds. The advances in AI have been at the forefront of Wall Street over the past few years, with tech stocks leading the charge. As the rally pushed share prices to record highs, questions persisted about whether it was a bubble about to burst — or would set off a productivity boom that would remake corporate America. WATCH: Rising fears about artificial intelligence are affecting the shares of companies at risk of being disrupted by it, from small software companies to big wealth-management firms. Bloomberg’s Stephanie Hughes explains.Source: Bloomberg But since early last week, a trickle of AI product rollouts triggered a stark sea change. Instead of focusing on picking the winners, investors instead are quickly trying to avoid getting caught owning any company with the slightest risk of being displaced. “I have no idea what’s next,” said Will Rhind, the CEO of Graniteshares Advisors. “The story from last year was we all believe in AI — but we’re searching for the use case,” he said. “And when we keep discovering the use cases that seemingly are more and more powerful and more and more compelling, it’s now leading to disruption.” In Europe, French software company Dassault Systemes tumbled 20% on Wednesday after it reported results that JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts said were “worse than even the most negative had feared.” The software industry has been dogged by worries about AI for some time. It started shifting more broadly to other sectors last week, when new tools from Anthropic PBC sparked a deep rout in stocks across the software, financial services, asset-management and legal-service sectors. Story Continues The same fears hammered shares of US insurance brokers on Monday after the online marketplace Insurify unveiled a new application that uses ChatGPT to compare auto-insurance rates. On Tuesday, wealth-management stocks were the next casualty, pulled down by Altruist’s product, Hazel, which helps financial advisers personalize strategies for clients. Altruist CEO Jason Wenk said even he was surprised by the scale of the stock market’s reaction, which wiped billions of dollars off the market values of a number of investment firms. But he said it sends a strong signal about the competitive threat posed by his company. “It’s dawning on people — this architecture we’re using to build Hazel, it can replace any job in wealth management,” he said in an interview. “Usually these are jobs done by entire teams. And they’ll be done with AI effectively for $100 a month.” AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have made solid inroads into software engineering with products that help developers streamline the process of writing and debugging code and are moving into other industries. Yet there are plenty of questions about how the technology will be adopted. The banking industry, for one, has seen periodic challenges from crypto, electronic services and other technology that ultimately have done little to chip away at its dominance. Belton, the fund manager with Gabelli, is among those who are skeptical of how Wall Street has gone from worrying about an AI bubble to fears that it’s poised to disrupt huge segments of the economy. “There’s going to be winners and losers in every industry,” Belton said. But, he added, “one rule of thumb is tech-disruption tends to take longer than expected to play out.” The pullbacks may also reflect the general anxiety about how much stocks have rallied over the past few years on the back of the AI spending boom and a surprisingly resilient US economy. That has stretched valuations and made investors sensitive to fears of a reversal. “If they just give a whiff of something that the market perceives as being somewhat negative, the stock’s going to sell off 10% in a way that would never happen in a market that was not trading at this level,” said Graniteshares’ Rhind said. To Ross Gerber, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki, the angst about AI losers that has been battering parts of the market for the past week is premature. He said it’s still far too early to say what exactly the fallout will be. “We can try to extrapolate out what the world will look like in five years with AI, but we just don’t know,” he said. “Markets are trying to make these calls on it when we’re still in the beginning of this infancy.” --With assistance from Seth Fiegerman, Hannah Levitt, Jenny Surane and Katherine Chiglinsky.

On Tuesday, stocks drifted on Wall Street following a mixed set of profit reports from big U.S. companies. Hopes rose that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this year to boost the economy following a discouraging report on U.S. shoppers' appetite for spending . “Fresh data points to softening U.S. consumer momentum since last December as wage growth cools and household credit stress builds,” Mizuho Bank said in a commentary.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1%, to its own record, closing at 50,188.14. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.6% to 23,102.47. The action was stronger in the bond market, where Treasury yields fell after a report showed U.S. retailers made less money at the end of last year than economists expected.

On Wednesday, the U.S. government will give the latest monthly update on the unemployment rate, while a report Friday will show how bad inflation is for U.S. consumers.

But a weakening of the job market, on the other hand, could push it to resume cuts more quickly. “Expectations are weak.

Most equity benchmarks in the region have risen in 2026, currencies have shown resilience against external pressures, and demand for credit has pushed spreads to near record lows.

Most Read from Bloomberg NJ Transit Service Between Trenton and New York City Resumes NY Private School Startup Seeks Edge by Giving 42% Fee Discount The Best Tactics for Tackling Speeders New York Faces Slippery Evening Commute as Storm Moves in Fast Its biggest tech firms are cementing their indispensability to the artificial intelligence supply chain, while countries from South Korea to Japan are taking steps to boost shareholder returns. A robust economic backdrop — reinforced by a weakening dollar — is adding to the allure, with the International Monetary Fund projecting that Asia will contribute around 60% of global growth this year. “Asia is really at a crossroad of three big thematics,” Aidan Yao, senior investment strategist for Asia at Amundi Investment Institute, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Tuesday. The first is AI, second is a corporate reform story in many markets, and the third is improving fundamentals, he added. Asia’s strength stands out when investors’ convictions in everything from tech stocks to precious metals and cryptocurrencies are being tested by shifting expectations for US interest rates and uncertainty over AI-driven disruption. A gauge of Asian equities climbed 7.5% in January — the best monthly advance since 2023 — and has extended gains to hit a fresh record on Wednesday. The moves compound a bumper year in 2025 and are helping the regional gauge outperform the S&P 500 Index as well as the STOXX Europe 600 Index. Leading the charge are the tech-heavy markets of South Korea and Taiwan, as well as Japan — where optimism is riding high after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s party just achieved the biggest post-war victory for a single party in a general election. Asia is winning favor with investors as the global tech race is shifting from AI pioneers to the enablers of large-scale adoption. Regional firms control critical choke points — from advanced chips and memory to foundry services and assembly — supplying much of the hardware underpinning the AI build-out. Story Continues “We’ve been positive on Korea and remain so. We’re overweight — it’s one of our top markets,” Timothy Moe, chief Asia Pacific equity strategist for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said on Bloomberg Television. “A significant part of it is this memory supercycle that we’re in which has very positive effects.” The greenback’s persistent decline provides another tailwind by easing pressure on Asian currencies and lowering the cost of servicing dollar-denominated debt. It’s also positive for emerging economies that rely heavily on imports priced in the currency. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell in five of the last six months thanks to the so-called debasement trade — wherein investors flocked to gold, silver and other precious metals, seeking a store of value to withstand a downswing in currency and bond markets as public finances deteriorate. Late in January, the gauge slid to its lowest level since 2022 as President Donald Trump indicated he was comfortable with the currency’s decline. An index of Asian currencies is up another 0.6% in 2026 after rising more than 3% last year — its first annual advance in five years. “A weaker US dollar is both a cause and a symptom of Asia’s outperformance,” said Kyle Rodda, senior financial market analyst at Capital.com. “The dollar would be higher if it weren’t for the political risk premium – the “sell America” trade – discounted into the currency.” That said, risks remain. And with sentiment firmly bullish, the margin for error is narrowing. Any disappointment in chip demand or pricing power would ripple across markets given that stocks are pricing in high earnings expectations. More broadly, while effective US tariffs turned out to be lower than the initial announcements for most Asian economies, further escalation of trade tensions is a key concern, according to the IMF. And, a looming change of guard at the Federal Reserve is adding to policy uncertainty. Wall Street investors and strategists said last month that Trump’s pick of Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed is a relatively hawkish choice, which will support the dollar and a steeper Treasury yield curve. “If the Trump administration maintains more stable trade and foreign policy, the dollar should recover a bit,” said Rodda. “This could tighten financial conditions in Asia and potentially lean against upside in the region’s stocks.” For now though, Asia’s credit markets too are going from strength to strength, and the AI trade has had a role to play here as well. Just as US chip demand is lifting Asian stocks, the AI build-out is tightening investment-grade credit spreads as investors favor high-quality issuers with durable cash flows and long order books. A measure of Asian dollar-based investment grade credit has outperformed its US and European counterparts in recent months. Global fixed income investors are showing signs of concerns about the scale of investment needed and levels of corporate debt issuance from so-called “hyperscaler” companies, according to Amy Xie Patrick, head of income strategies for Pendal Group Ltd. in Sydney. “Over 50% of hyperscaler capex this year is expected to be funded from US investment grade issuance,” Patrick said, adding that worries about the rising issuance could spur a rotation away from US investment grade credit into corporate debt in markets like Australia. --With assistance from Abhishek Vishnoi, David Ingles, Annabelle Droulers and Finbarr Flynn.

Liu envisioned tokenizing all world assets on-chain, enabling seamless access from everyday payments to high-frequency trading and creating a unified, global marketplace for capital formation. Liu traced crypto's capital-raising evolution from early ICOs to rapid modern raises, arguing this extensible primitive should empower non-crypto projects and companies worldwide. Liu stressed democratising talent and capital formation, which is rare in most markets, as crypto's core societal impact. Highlighting Asia's pivotal role, Liu called it crypto's ""core market,"" not frontier, given its Bitcoin origins and vast user/talent base.

What she did exactly, well, that turned into a perplexing question for two major prediction markets. At least one Kalshi trader filed a complaint with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over how the prediction market handled Sunday's appearance by the Grammy-winning rapper. The result of a similar event contract on Polymarket also drew the ire of some users on that platform.

Prediction markets provide an opportunity to trade — or wager — on the result of future events. The markets are comprised of typically yes-or-no questions called event contracts, with the prices connected to what traders are willing to pay, which theoretically indicates the perceived probability of an event occurring. The buy-in for each contract ranges from $0 to $1 each, reflecting a 0% to 100% chance of what traders think could happen. More than $47.3 million was wagered on Kalshi’s market for “ Who will perform at the Big Game? ” A Polymarket contract had more than $10 million in volume. Cardi B joined singers Karol G and Young Miko and actors Jessica Alba and Pedro Pascal on a starry front porch during the halftime spectacle. She danced to the music, but it was unclear whether she was singing along during the show, which included performances by Ricky Martin and Lady Gaga. Due to “ambiguity over whether or not Cardi B’s attendance at the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show constituted a qualifying ‘performance,’” Kalshi cited one of its rules in settling the market at the last price before trading was paused: $0.74 for No holders and $0.26 for Yes holders. The platform returned all the money to its users. Polymarket's contract was resolved as Cardi B had performed, but the yes was disputed. A final decision on the contract is expected to be announced on Wednesday. In the CFTC complaint — first reported by the Event Horizon newsletter and posted by Front Office Sports — the trader alleges that Kalshi violated the Commodity Exchange Act with how it resolved the Cardi B contract. The trader — a Yes holder — is seeking $3,700. A message was left Tuesday night seeking more information from the CFTC. The Super Bowl capped a big NFL season for prediction markets. Kalshi reported a daily record high of more than $1 billion in total trading volume on the day of the game, an increase of more than 2,700% compared to last year's Super Bowl. The season-long total for all Super Bowl winner futures was $828.6 million, up more than 2,000% from last year. The increased activity on Sunday caused some deposit issues.

2026-02-11 09:52:21,"This Is the Top-Rated Dividend Stock to Buy in February 2026 CMCL’s low payout ratio, hedged $3,500‑floor gold pricing, and 56% implied upside from its lone “Strong Buy” target make it an attractive small‑cap dividend grower for 2026.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-rated-dividend-stock-buy-003002728.html,"In this article: GC=F CMCL Gold hit fresh record highs in 2025, and that has made it a lot more relevant for income investors. According to Statista, gold prices rallied by more than 50% through October 2025, which is the strongest annual gain since 1979, as the metal pushed past $4,000 per troy ounce with ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and continued monetary easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Forecasts for 2026 still point to gold averaging above $4,000 per ounce, and some analysts think it could get close to $5,000 at some point during the year. As spot prices moved up, gold mining stocks generally followed, and that has opened a window where investors may be able to get both price gains and dividend income from profitable producers. Caledonia Mining Corporation (CMCL) is one of the names that fits that description. More News from Barchart As Crypto Collapses, Buy This 1 Trillion-Dollar Dividend Stock Instead As Silver Prices Plunge, This CIO Warns That Precious Metals Are Nothing More Than Meme Stocks Forget High Yield: This Dividend King Is up Nearly 900% Tired of missing midday reversals? The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now! It is a Zimbabwe-focused gold miner with a forward annual dividend of $0.56 per share and a 2.11% yield, and it also ranks as a top-rated pick on Barchart ’s dividend stock screen, sitting in a part of the gold space where companies are posting positive earnings while still returning cash to shareholders. But can a small-cap miner with a single analyst rating and a relatively modest yield truly deserve top billing in a dividend-focused portfolio for February 2026? Let’s find out. The Numbers Behind the Rating Caledonia Mining is a smaller gold producer that mainly runs on its long-life Blanket Mine in Zimbabwe, and it uses the steady production from that mine to support both dividends and its next stage of growth. The stock has been a standout in performance, up about 187% over the past 52 weeks, and it is also up around 11% year-to-date (YTD) in the early part of 2026. www.barchart.com The valuation still looks reasonable, with CMCL trading at about 8.5x forward earnings compared with roughly 18.55x for the wider materials sector. On the dividend side, the story is also pretty straightforward. Caledonia has a forward payout ratio of about 18.72%; it pays dividends quarterly, and it has now raised the dividend for one year in a row. The stock’s 2.11% yield is not far from the materials sector’s 2.82% average, and it sits on a business doing about $183 million in annual sales and around $18 million in annual net income. Story Continues The latest production numbers back that up. FY 2025 gold output at Blanket was 76,213 ounces, which landed at the upper end of guidance and was broadly in line with the prior two years. Q4 2025 production came in at 17,367 ounces, down from 19,841 ounces in Q4 2024, mainly due to lower tonnages from higher-grade areas and electricity supply disruptions late in the quarter, issues management is already working through. Milling throughput stayed strong, which helped soften the impact of the grade pressure and supported the cash base that funds both dividends and growth. What Keeps the Dividend Growing Caledonia’s growth plan is very focused on specific projects, which makes sense for a small-cap dividend stock. The goal is to keep the dividend on track by generating more cash from its existing Blanket Mine, while also spending heavily to grow into a multi-asset producer through Bilboes and Motapa. For 2026, management has budgeted about $162.5 million in total group capital expenditure, with roughly $132 million set aside for building out Bilboes and $3.8 million for Motapa exploration. That spending is meant to move Bilboes from a development plan into a producing asset, while Motapa is the exploration angle that could extend growth beyond the Bilboes build. With capex at that level, funding matters just as much as the projects themselves, because weak financing can put pressure on a dividend. In January 2026, Caledonia closed an upsized $150 million convertible senior notes offering, which gives the company meaningful long-term capital to actually carry out the Bilboes plan. The company has also added a cash-flow buffer through hedging. Caledonia has put a gold hedging program in place by purchasing put options that lock in a minimum price of $3,500 per ounce on about 3,000 ounces per month from January 2026 through December 2028. The idea is to support cash coming in from Blanket during what should be the heaviest Bilboes spending period so a weaker gold price does not force tough decisions around shareholder returns. What Lies Ahead for CMCL Management is guiding Blanket Mine to produce between 72,000 and 76,500 ounces of gold this year. Production is expected to be stronger in the second half, as higher-grade zones gradually come into the mine plan. That matters because it points to better volumes and cash flow at the same time as spending on Bilboes is picking up. On costs, Caledonia expects on-mine cash costs of $1,500 to $1,700 per ounce sold and all-in sustaining costs of $2,100 to $2,300 per ounce sold. In other words, 2026 is not shaping up to be a cheap year to operate but a year when the company is taking on higher costs and investment to support future production. CMCL currently has a “Strong Buy” rating, based on coverage from one analyst. That lone analyst’s mean price target is $45, and against the current price of $28.91, that implies about 56% upside. www.barchart.com Conclusion CMCL does deserve a spot near the top of a dividend-focused buy list for February 2026, not because it has the highest yield, but because it blends real profitability, a low payout ratio, and a clearly funded growth agenda at a valuation that still looks conservative versus its sector. The tradeoff is that you are buying a miner heading into a heavy-capex year, so execution at Blanket and discipline around Bilboes matter as much as the gold price. If gold stays firm and the company hits its second-half production step-up, the path of least resistance for the shares is higher, with volatility along the way. If costs run hot or timelines slip, the stock can cool off even in a strong gold tape.

The scale and speed of the selloff has pushed investors toward a dramatic conclusion: AI is killing software.

Our exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. Subscribe today! But in this software-focused video segment from Friday’s Market on Close , Senior Market Strategist John Rowland, CMT, argues a different case: This isn’t a death spiral for software stocks. It’s a capitulation — and those moments tend to separate the long-term survivors from the casualties. A Selloff Defined by Extremes, Not Subtlety On a relative-performance basis, software has collapsed. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (IGV) has been crushed while AI hardware and infrastructure names remain near highs. From a technical standpoint, the sector has pushed multiple standard deviations below its historical mean — a rare, statistically extreme event. www.barchart.com These types of moves are typically driven by: Forced selling Risk reduction Narrative compression … and not careful discrimination between business models. That distinction matters. AI Isn’t Killing Software The fear-driven narrative around software right now is simple: AI agents can write code, automate workflows, and replace tasks once handled by software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms. If AI can do the work, why pay recurring software fees? Markets love simple narratives during selloffs — even when they’re incomplete. Instead, Rowland frames this moment as a filtering event: Undifferentiated, easily replaceable software is vulnerable. Mission-critical platforms embedded into real workflows are not. He grounds this with an anecdote describing real-world usage. Across healthcare, HR, sales, and engineering, SaaS tools like Salesforce (CRM) remain deeply integrated. That broadly ingrained usage across industries isn’t theoretical; it’s a structural advantage. Story Continues And importantly, Salesforce is one of the few large software names showing relative resilience inside a collapsing sector. Barron’s and the Case for Cybersecurity Survivors Where the discussion becomes most constructive is cybersecurity. As explained recently by Barron's, AI agents don’t remove risk — they expand it. Autonomous systems require identity controls, access permissions, and audit trails. Someone still has to guard the doors, whether figuratively or literally. That’s why identity and security software stand apart. Barron’s highlighted Okta (OKTA), which is also a favorite of John’s. He notes OKTA stock has quietly held a higher low while the broader software ETF made fresh lows — a classic sign of relative strength during panic. Rowland also calls out some of the positive or stabilizing performances inside IGV from differentiated software leaders: Atlassian (TEAM) Zoom (ZM) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) These aren’t random software names — they share entrenchment, switching costs, or security relevance. Tradable Fear vs. Investable Confirmation As with his thesis on Microsoft (MSFT) after earnings, John is careful not to blur timeframes. From a trading perspective: Volatility is elevated Fear is priced in Options premiums are rich This creates opportunity for defined-risk strategies, including selling puts inside clearly established demand zones. From an investing perspective, though, the sector is still below key trend levels. The signal John’s watching for now is a reclaiming of the 50-day moving average, which would suggest fear is fading and institutions are returning. Until then, this remains a market ruled by caution — not conviction. The Bigger Picture The “SaaS-pocalypse” isn’t about AI destroying software. It’s about: A violent rotation Valuations unwinding Investors reassessing which software deserves a premium in an AI-driven world Some companies will lose relevance. But others — especially those tied to security, identity, and core enterprise workflows — may emerge stronger once the panic clears.

UPWK now sits decisively below its 200-day moving average (MA), signaling a bearish technical setup and waning investor confidence in the near term.

The FREE Barchart Brief newsletter keeps you in the know. Sign up now! Versus its year-to-date high, Upwork stock is now down more than 30%. www.barchart.com AI Tailwinds Could Help Upwork Stock Recover According to Upwork, its revenue will fall between $192 million and $197 million in Q1, with up to $0.28 of earnings on a per-share basis. Analysts, in comparison, had called for $200.5 million in revenue and $0.34 in earnings per share (EPS). However, this guidance may prove conservative, given the management’s commitment to artificial intelligence (AI) represents a material growth driver that’s being undervalued in the current risk-off environment. In Q4, gross services value derived from AI-related work surpassed $300 million, up 50% year-over-year, reinforcing the marketplace’s ability to capture substantial value from the evolving AI economy. Notably, nearly 70% of all job posts on the platform are now touched by Uma, the company's proprietary artificial intelligence tool, indicating deep penetration of AI capabilities across its user base. This positioning as a foundational platform for AI-era work suggests notable long-term optionality that warrants investing in UPWK stock on the post-earnings plunge. UPWK Shares Are Now Trading at a Discount While a 6% decline in active clients seems like a headwind, gross services value per active client went up 7% in the fourth quarter, suggesting the firm is better monetizing its remaining user base. What it signals is a qualitative shift toward higher-value engagements and more profitable client relationships. Additionally, Upwork shares are now trading at a compelling valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of about 13x only indicating they’re trading at a discount to both historical norms and peer valuations. Note that UPWK’s relative strength index (14-day) is now hovering around 30, indicating dovish momentum is approaching exhaustion. Story Continues How Wall Street Suggests Playing Upwork Wall Street analysts also seem to believe Upwork’s year-to-date decline is rather overdone, given the company maintains solid financial health with $673 million in cash and marketable securities. The consensus rating on UPWK shares sits at a “Moderate Buy” currently, with the mean target of roughly $24 indicating potential upside of some 60% from here. www.barchart.com This article was created with the support of automated content tools from our partners at Sigma.AI.
